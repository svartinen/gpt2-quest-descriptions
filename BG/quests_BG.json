I will give you these six scrolls of stone to flesh. Use them on the statues when you find them.\nThe estate can be found just west of the fairgrounds in the center of town. Good luck, and don't entertain any thoughts about betraying me. It could be very hazardous to your health.\nYou will be paid 5,000 gold for this service.

My brother called her the Blue Lady and those of us who ply these waters have all heard her singing at one time or another. My brother, Evan, heard her more than most. I think that he went to find her. I think that he is under her spell. I must go and find him. This witch might kill him. He is strong but he is under her spell. I fear that she will kill him before he realizes what is happening. Can you find my brother?\nI don't know exactly where the Blue Lady is. I have the sense to avoid her, unlike Evan. But I have only heard her singing along the west coast of the island."

All the guard are still grieving the loss of Commander Brage.\nThe commander was friend to many before he found a cursed sword. He's not the man he was, by Helm. I'll not believe a man of Brage's rank could kill his own family. 'Twas evil magics of some sort. An entire unit went west after Brage to try to talk some sense to him. It's been a week, and none have returned.\nThe reward for the commander's head is a king's ransom, but I'll not be lifting MY sword against a brother soldier.\nTravel lightly, wanderer.

He's offered 2,000 gold for its head. Now before you get cold feet, let me allay your fears. The only descriptions of the beast have always mentioned its deadly barbed tail. From what I know about dragons they don't have barbs on their tails \u2014 that's something unique to wyverns. So all we have to do is find this wyvern's nest and kill it.

After all, we're doing it all for the sake of Skie.\nNow, we needn't go about this right away. In fact, I'll help you with whatever you're doing until you decide to head up to Baldur's Gate.

If you do find out what's been happening, come to see me at the Flaming Fist barracks. Our only clue so far has led us to the sewers, so if you want to explore them first, it would probably be a good idea.
