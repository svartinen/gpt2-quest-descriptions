It would seem he's the cook.\nYou are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found. Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him. Loose ends and all that.\nAs I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place.

They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.\nThese dreams are manifestations created by Vaermina. She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares, not unlike a cough marks a serious illness. I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.\nI need to return to the source of the problem, to Nightcaller Temple. Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard? I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic. I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end Dawnstar's nightmares.\nNightcaller Temple is only a short walk from Dawnstar. Come, we must hurry."

My client is offering quite a reward for them, which I'd split with you.\nRecently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar. The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.\nHe used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down. The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform. After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.\nIn his later years, Arondil moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild.

It took me weeks, but I finally tracked down the killer. A bloody Altmer at that. Can you imagine? Let's just say I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye and leave it at that.\nThe killer fancied himself a thief in some sort of a new Guild forming around here. Gave me some valuable information before... well, you know. Well, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process. One of the pieces stolen from Fjotli was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back.\nThe only name I have is Niranye. Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking."

I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the Thieves Guild.  The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called Pinewatch.\nI'm not sure how many men they have inside, but I trust that won't be an issue for you.

So little of what I have learned matters now - the petty politics of ancient times, the age-long campaign to wipe out all mention of the Gauldur name.\nIn the opening days of the First Era, the Archmage Gauldur was revered throughout the north. Wisdom, wealth, honor, and power were his, and even the legendary heros' heirs sought his counsel.\nSmothered by his shadow, Gauldur's three sons grew cruel and resentful. They lusted after their father's power and prestige, and eventually Jyrik, the eldest, discovered its source: a mysterious amulet, from which he never parted. Together, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his amulet between them. And so it was done.\nConsumed by their newfound power, the brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages. So great was the carnage that the High King himself intervened, sending a company of battlemages led by the Archmage Geirmund to subdue the brothers. And after a devastating battle, the three fled the field.\nMikrul, the youngest, was run to ground in Folgunthur, the ancient barrows at the foot of Solitude. Geirmund pursued Jyrik to the shattered crypts of Saarthal, half-buried even then. And at last, Sigdis was cornered in the southernmost reaches of land and later entombed in Geirmund's Hall."

Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure Astrid indicated.\nWith the Emperor's arrival in Skyrim now a certainty, his security service, the Penitus Oculatus, will need to begin its preparations immediately. Security is being handled by a Commander Maro. Astrid and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection.\nYou are to slay the commander's son, Gaius Maro, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor. He is set to leave the Penitus Oculatus outpost at Dragon Bridge, and inspect the security of each city in Skyrim. Go there now. Observe Gaius Maro's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis. Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest. Oh, and one final thing...\nTo earn your bonus, do not kill Gaius Maro in Dragon Bridge, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting. There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating Gaius Maro in the plot to assassinate the Emperor. Do that, and Astrid has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to Olava the Feeble, in Whiterun. Olava is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up."

If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power.\nThe Companions of old became werewolves. They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived. The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity. And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.\nI've spent my twilight years trying to find a cure myself. And now I've found the answer.

Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... mystery.\nThis mystery is their disappearance, of course! Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened. After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation.\nOnly now... Well, it's simply a disaster. Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event. I used the soul gem you brought me for this. The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The Dwemer had machines for this sort of thing. I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwemer machine. It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.\nThe designs for my Convector were based on real Dwemer machines, so there may still be some in existence. I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations. Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.\nJust place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors. I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.\nBut, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?"

I think perhaps you could help.\nI made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough. My knowledge of history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.\nFirst, there are ancient references to dragon \"heartscales\". What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need. Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve heartscales off a dragon.\nFirst you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few heartscales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.\nIf my research succeeds, I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the Dragonhide spell tome."

Well, he was. It's... it's complicated. Florentius's a little eccentric, but we can trust him and we could definitely use his skills.\nHere's the thing. We don't know where Florentius is. Haven't seen him in years. I think he had regular contact with the Vigilants, and I know Isran kept track of them... So maybe you could ask Isran if he knows anything?\nJust keep in mind that Isran... well, he might not like the idea. The two of them just never got along."
