# rpg-quest-data-set

A collection of quests from Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Minecraft, and Torchlight II. The quests from BG, BGII, TES IV, and TES V were pieced together from dialogue files extracted with modding tools. The Minecraft quests were written manually by us. The quests from TLII were originally collected by van Stegeren and Theune ([repo](https://github.com/hmi-utwente/video-game-text-corpora)) and edited by us.
