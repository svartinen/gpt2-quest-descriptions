State your business with the guard and go! Oh, that came out a bit harsher than I meant. I am sorry for my mood. All the guard are still grieving the loss of Commander Brage.
The commander was friend to many before he found a cursed sword. He's not the man he was, by Helm. I'll not believe a man of Brage's rank could kill his own family. 'Twas evil magics of some sort. An entire unit went west after Brage to try to talk some sense to him. It's been a week, and none have returned.
The reward for the commander's head is a king's ransom, but I'll not be lifting MY sword against a brother soldier.
Travel lightly, wanderer. The woods harbor strange things.

If I might pull on your coattail a moment more, I have a proposition for you. It's usually nature-quiet by the Firewine ruins, even with its violent bygone. Those who died and did not sleep have mostly found their rest over time. It's a live threat that comes now, with a band of kobolds that moved in.
Perhaps we could prevail upon you to rid us of this menace, and in return, a gift from us you shall receive. Keep whatever you find as well.

I have enough magical skill to reverse the curse if I had the formula for his spell.

<|begin_description|>
Greetings, traveler. I am Sir Ryan Trawl. I have heard of you. I would like to offer you the opportunity to help the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.
The task of being a paladin is not easy. Many break under the demands of our path and leave to pursue avenues of life more appropriate to their talents. Sometimes they bend instead of break, twisting their paladinhood to serve their own purpose. These are hard to detect, but when found, they are quickly cast out.
Recently, one of our highest-ranking officers was implicated in smuggling slaves. His name is Anarg, and though he was once a friend, he was expelled from the Order. We thought that the end of it, but Anarg took others when he left. He is a charismatic man, and some of the younger knights were swayed by his words. We could tolerate their loss, but they masquerade as paladins, abusing our good name. They extort, smuggle slaves, and spit on all that we honor. The Fallen Paladins, as they're known, would recognize any of our Order, and some also fear conflict with former friends, so we need outside help in this matter.
The Fallen Paladins always need warriors to aid their illegal activities. We want you to ally with them, especially Anarg. He's the key to them all. If you consider these men a threat, then do what you think is necessary. Gloves of Healing would be a suitable reward for the task, I think.
Anarg has kept their activities localized in the Bridge District. I suggest you search there. May Torm be with you.

Long have the trolls of the mound lived beneath the protection of the grove. But a new leader has arisen. Nilthiri the shamaness leads the trolls to chaos. She urges them to expand their territory, and she brings more trolls to the mound without thought to the consequences. If this continues, the trolls will overrun the grove, and nature will suffer. A servant of nature must bring the life cycle of Nilthiri to a close for the good of all.

Dead Drop Orders #1
by Lucien Lachance

Silencer,
You are now reading your first dead drop note, here on Hero Hill, which proves to me you were well-appointed to the tasks that lie ahead.
Journey now to Leafrot Cave. There you will encounter an ancient necromancer who is attempting to escape death by transforming himself into a lich. This necromancer, Celedaen, has not yet completed his metamorphosis, but is still immensely powerful, possibly too powerful to destroy if confronted directly. Search Leafrot Cave. Necromancers are wizards after all, and wizards are prolific by nature. Celedaen surely has written records, and these records may contain evidence of some kind of weakness. Perhaps there is some other way to destroy Celedaen besides a direct confrontation. But destroy him you must!
When the necromancer lies dead, journey to the city of Chorrol for your next dead drop. At the foot of the Great Oak, hidden in the bushes, is an old sack. Inside you will find your reward for killing the necromancer, as well as information regarding your next contract.
Serve me well, Silencer, and there's no telling just how far you might advance.

Slythe's Journal
by Slythe Seringi

As midnight approaches, I still watch the fires burn. The great city of man, Kvatch, lay in ruins. They didn't heed my words. They didn't listen to my voice. Now, they are all paying the cost of ignorance. The Sunken One strikes swift and hard. He swats those who oppose Him as if they did not exist at all. The excuses of man fall upon deaf ears. The Sunken One has no pity; He has no mercy, He only sits below and passes sentence. And now, with a mighty stroke, He's toppled one of man's pitiful blights on His land. And yet, He still hungers. His appetite is voracious. Kvatch will not be the last city to fall by His hand. The world of man grows more and more corrupt, and it angers Him. Man's lies and deceit will be his undoing as The Sunken One grows impatient and no longer waits for or accepts the proper offering.
The burden is mine to shoulder. I am the last who knows of He Who Shakes The Ground. If I do not bring him the Offering, who knows what city may fall prey to his whim? Anvil? Chorrol? Or perhaps He will turn his eyes on the greatest boil of all, the great Imperial City itself. No, I must not let that happen. I must get the Offering to him like my father did before me. Man may be fallen in His eyes, but they must have time to learn The Sunken One's teachings. Destroying man now would be a waste, when I am certain that given the chance, they will come to see His ways. Yes, I will do this thing. I will brave the depths of Sandstone Cavern to see Him. My weapons will be my will and my word. The Sunken One will watch over me and guide me. I must depart soon, before it is too late. If anyone finds this journal, let them know that I, Slythe Seringi, do this for the good of all man.

The last thoughts of one of Crucible's residents

I don't think I'll live much longer. My wine supply is thinning, only one bottle left. Bernice's wine is worthless! I would have lasted longer on bark. I'd go back home to resupply, but Brithaur, that maggot, has stolen my house. It's not just him, though, it's also the others. I can't leave the safety of the roof. They have a plan for me, I see it in their eyes. Caldana, Earil, Cutter, ALL OF THEM!
They don't know I'm up here, watching. Not much longer, though. At least they won't find me or my stash. I've put all my favorite things in an urn, and sunken it in the sewage near the back of Bernice's dive.
I think I'll drink that last bottle to celebrate.

<|end_tools|>
<|begin_description|>
So you are here for your recommendation? Unlike some frivolous tasks you may be given at other guild halls, this is a serious matter, and has consequences. Are you prepared?
Allow me to explain the task. The Council of Mages has entrusted me with resolving a situation along the Gold Road. Several traveling merchants have been found dead along the Gold Road recently, with even more missing. The Council has asked that I put a stop to it. You are going to help me do so.
As you are new to the guild, you are less likely to be recognized as a member. This may give you an advantage in getting to the root of the problem. We believe the killings are the actions of a rogue mage. Battlemages have been sent to the Brina Cross Inn, the only common link between the victims.
You are to travel north to the Brina Cross Inn, and speak with Arielle Jurard. She will give you further instructions.
This is a harsh, dangerous task for you, I realize. Your unfamiliar face makes you most useful, however. And, what better way to learn the many uses of Restoration? Practical application is often the best educator. Even in life and death situations.

I am Alessandra, a priest of Arkay.
My father was a Priest of Arkay, as well. All my life was spent around the dead, being forced to learn the proper burial rituals and prayers. I never had any friends; who'd want to spend time with 'the little weird girl who hangs around dead people?' So I grew up with a miserable trade. This is all I know how to do... prepare and inter the deceased.
I'd like to make the journey to the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun and give my ceremonial dagger to Andurs, the caretaker. I believe once it's interred with my father's remains I'll be at peace with his memory.
A Priest of Arkay is entrusted with a ceremonial dagger once they've completed their training. It's usually given by the head priest who sanctified the ritual. In my case, the head priest happened to be my father. The thing is, I never wanted to follow in his footsteps... In some ways I still don't.
I'm entrusting you with the dagger. Bring it to Andurs and he'll take care of the rest.

Passing through on your way to High Hrothgar? About to make a delivery up there myself.
I mostly deliver food supplies like dried fish and salted meats; you know, things that keep fresh for a long time. The Greybeards tend not to get out much, if you catch my meaning.
It's kind of an understanding between us. I mean, it just wouldn't feel right to charge them for a bit of preserved food. Trouble is, my legs aren't what they used to be and climbing the 7,000 Steps takes its toll.
You'd like to make the delivery for me? Really? That would be kind of you. Here, take this bag of supplies. At the top of the steps you'll see the offering chest. Just leave the bag inside and you're done.

Mining gear? No. However, I used to sell East Empire Pendants until I ran out of them. Popular little item.
It's an amulet that was made exclusively for the East Empire Company. They gave them to their workers as an incentive at one point... a kind of reward for extra effort. They're no longer being made, so they've become collectible. I'd love to get my hands on a few of them.
They could be anywhere on the island. The mines might be a good place to start. If you find any while you're exploring Solstheim, bring them here and I'll pay you for them.

The Divines are stolen idols! Impostor gods, sold by silver tongues. No thank you. Froki will not forget Kyne, or her Sacred Trials.
Kyne's Sacred Trials is an old tradition, a test to prove your worth in the eyes of Kyne. Show that you're a hunter and no simple butcher. Kyne teaches us to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True hunters are those who survive the Trials.
Do you think you're strong enough for Kyne's blessing? I would be glad to pass this tradition down. You must defeat guardian beasts, blessed by Kyne. I'll anoint you with the symbol of the wolf, the crab and the skeever. This will compel the guardian to appear when you reach his lair.
Return when you've defeated the guardian wolf, crab and skeever.

When the Zeraphi and Ezrohir "parted ways," they designated the nearby fortress of Riftkeep as a neutral ground, where they could meet and talk over their differences. But it has remained unused for centuries... until a few weeks ago, when the Ezrohir army seized the fortress. They have occupied it ever since, and that is surely where they are holding the Guardian of Mana while they marshal their forces.
The Ezrohir will be expecting the Zeraphi to attack them at Riftkeep, to attempt to rescue the Guardian. But they know it will take time for the Zeraphi to arrive. You can get there much more quickly, and fight your way inside before they are prepared to repel you.
Go. Fight past the Ezrohir and free the Guardian!

Black Blindness is an insidious disease - it dims the vision and makes speech impossible, and if not treated within a few weeks, can become permanent. The only known treatment is produced from the flesh of the Blue Boletus - a species of mushroom creatures that grows only in the Fungal Caves near here.
