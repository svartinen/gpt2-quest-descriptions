The commander was friend to many before he found a cursed sword. He's not the man he was, by Helm. I'll not believe a man of character_0's rank could kill his own family.

The reward for the commander's head is a king's ransom, but I'll not be lifting MY sword against a brother soldier.
Travel lightly, wanderer. The woods harbor strange things."

The task of being a paladin is not easy. Many break under the demands of our path and leave to pursue avenues of life more appropriate to their talents. Sometimes they bend instead of break, twisting their paladinhood to serve their own purpose. These are hard to detect, but when found, they are quickly cast out.
Recently, one of our highest-ranking officers was implicated in smuggling slaves. His name is character_0, and though he was once a friend, he was expelled from the Order. We thought that the end of it, but character_0 took others when he left. He is a charismatic man, and some of the younger knights were swayed by his words. We could tolerate their loss, but they masquerade as paladins, abusing our good name. They extort, smuggle slaves, and spit on all that we honor. The group_0, as they're known, would recognize any of our Order, and some also fear conflict with former friends, so we need outside help in this matter.
The group_0 always need warriors to aid their illegal activities. We want you to ally with them, especially character_0. He's the key to them all. If you consider these men a threat, then do what you think is necessary. Gloves of Healing would be a suitable reward for the task, I think.
character_0 has kept their activities localized in the task_location_0. I suggest you search there. May Torm be with you."

Silencer,
You are now reading your first dead drop note, here on location_1, which proves to me you were well-appointed to the tasks that lie ahead.
Journey now to task_location_0. There you will encounter an ancient necromancer who is attempting to escape death by transforming himself into a lich.

Serve me well, Silencer, and there's no telling just how far you might advance."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"quest_giver's Journal
by quest_giver

As midnight approaches, I still watch the fires burn. The great city of man, location_0, lay in ruins. They didn't heed my words. They didn't listen to my voice. Now, they are all paying the cost of ignorance. The character_0_0 strikes swift and hard. character_0_1 swats those who oppose Him as if they did not exist at all. The excuses of man fall upon deaf ears. The character_0_0 has no pity; character_0_1 has no mercy, character_0_1 only sits below and passes sentence. And now, with a mighty stroke, character_0_1's toppled one of man's pitiful blights on His land. And yet, character_0_1 still hungers. His appetite is voracious. location_0 will not be the last city to fall by His hand. The world of man grows more and more corrupt, and it angers Him. Man's lies and deceit will be his undoing as The character_0_0 grows impatient and no longer waits for or accepts the proper offering.
The burden is mine to shoulder. I am the last who knows of character_0_1. If I do not bring him the Offering, who knows what city may fall prey to his whim? location_1? location_2? Or perhaps character_0_1 will turn his eyes on the greatest boil of all, the great location_3 itself. No, I must not let that happen. I must get the Offering to him like my father did before me. Man may be fallen in His eyes, but they must have time to learn The character_0_0's teachings. Destroying man now would be a waste, when I am certain that given the chance, they will come to see His ways. Yes, I will do this thing. I will brave the depths of task_location_0 to see Him. My weapons will be my will and my word. The character_0_0 will watch over me and guide me. I must depart soon, before it is too late. If anyone finds this journal, let them know that I, quest_giver, do this for the good of all man."

As you are new to the guild, you are less likely to be recognized as a member. This may give you an advantage in getting to the root of the problem. We believe the killings are the actions of a rogue mage. Battlemages have been sent to the task_location_0, the only common link between the victims.
You are to travel north to the task_location_0, and speak with character_0. She will give you further instructions.
This is a harsh, dangerous task for you, I realize. Your unfamiliar face makes you most useful, however. And, what better way to learn the many uses of Restoration? Practical application is often the best educator. Even in life and death situations."
