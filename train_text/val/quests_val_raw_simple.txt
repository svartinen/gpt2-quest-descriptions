The Morningales have been a model of decency in this city, and their work in opposing the slave trade has earned them renown across the land. It also earned them many enemies. This past tenday has seen the family murdered in their homes, almost to the last. It would seem they were made examples of.
The time for justice will come, but what is important now is that someone survived, praise Helm. Tyrianna â€” she hid in a cellar while all others were executed. She must be protected until escorted from the city. Her survival will be a symbol to persevere in the fight against slavery, despite the ferocity of the enemy. You will go to a safe house we have set up, and you will make sure she remains secure. It is as secret as we could make it, though nothing is ever absolute.
In the morning, her godparent will arrive. He is from Baldur's Gate and will accept no other guards besides his own. You will see that she reaches his care. Go to the building beside the temple in the docks and await him. She should be safe in his care. Hurgis Baltezan is his name, and a more upright citizen you will not find. He earned the title "Hand of Torm" in his service to the god of duty.
The Order shall reward you with a suit of powerful armor for your good works.

Locations:
Mae'Var's guild house, one of Renal's guild houses to the south

Facts:
Renal will give the player papers which say that the player was being transferred by the Shadowmaster
the player is supposed to spy on Mae'Var from the inside
the player will need to reassure Mae'Var

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
My name is Renal, as I'm sure you've been told. Renal "Bloodscalp"... a little nickname I've earned over time. Rather grisly, but it keeps the fearful in line.
One of my guild houses to the south is run by a rather ambitious fellow named Mae'Var. Good thief, but I never liked him. Now I know why. I've had some hints that he is getting too big for himself. Thinking of taking my place, I suspect, but I've had no real evidence to say that this is so.
I will give you papers saying you were being transferred by the Shadowmaster. You will spy on Mae'Var from the inside and find me the evidence that I need. You'll need to reassure Mae'Var, naturally. He won't know who you are, but I am confident that you are more than capable of this.
Just head to the storefront in the central docks area and speak to the storekeeper, Gorch. Show the papers to him, and he'll let you in the guild house proper.
I think you will find the reward adequate. 10,000 gold is no small fortune, though I think you deserve a little more. From my personal armory, a sword.

I can't believe this is happening. Please... please. I need your help. My husband was no vampire! It's ridiculous! No one will listen to me! Forgive me. I loved my husband dearly, and to lose him this way makes no sense. Anything you can do to help would be wonderful. This is all happening so fast.
I came home only just a few hours ago. I found the door open, and my Bradon dead. Standing over him was a Dunmer. I screamed and ran out into the street. Some city watch were nearby and heard me I suppose, as they arrived quickly. I heard the Dunmer identify himself as Raynil Dralas. He said he was a vampire hunter and that Bradon was his mark. The guards seemed to know about Raynil, and after a search of the house, the body of some beggar was found stashed in our basement. The guards sent for Carius, who is an investigator for crimes here in Bruma. In minutes, Raynil convinced Carius that Bradon was a vampire.
Why would he stash a body in his own house? That's ridiculous! And another thing. The guards are making a big deal out of no one seeing Bradon out in the daylight. Well of course that's the case! He works at night, and has to sleep during the day. Why does that make him a vampire? It's all that Raynil character. I don't trust him. The thing that bothers me the most is that I swear I've seen him before. Of course he says he's never been here. Look, there isn't much more to say. Please... help me clear my husband's name.
Just find Raynil Dralas, and make him tell you the truth. I swear, he's a liar!

I'd get more work done if it weren't for my layabout double living in town. Terrible drain on productivity. Never know who's who. It's been a problem for too long.
A wizard did it. Stupid layabout mage. Had a theory about each of us having a Manic and Demented side. He decided to test the theory. Cast a spell. Split us all in two. Do we get twice the work done? No! Ridiculous. We're not allowed to take care of it either. There are rules. And I don't want to end up on the Hill of Suicides. You, on the other hand....
Get rid of that Demented bunch. Useless, anyway. Don't get a lick of work done around Split. If you get rid of them, I'll make it worth your while.

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
I'm Maelona. How would you like to get my husband, Gogan, out of hot water?
Believe me, he'll need all the help he can get to worm his way out of this one. To think he'd fall for the gang's scheme... agh! I could kill him! I'm sorry... I'm rambling and got you confused. Let me explain.
The women in the gang use their wiles to lure men out to some remote location and rob them blind. It's been going on for some time now. The city guard hasn't done very much about it, because frankly, the men who are robbed are so embarrassed, they don't want to report it. Take for example that good-for-nothing husband of mine, Gogan. He cared more about their charms than my own.
When Gogan was, uh... with the women, they took something quite valuable from him. No... it's not what you're thinking. He was carrying a precious family heirloom with him when he was lured out to their lair. It was a small ring given to him on our wedding day. The ring belonged to my mother, and has been in the family for generations. I'm willing to give you all the money I have to get it back. 100 gold. Can you help us?
All I can tell you is that the best place to start is at The Flowing Bowl. It's a tavern located outside the city walls near the waterfront. The Flowing Bowl attracts the worst Anvil has to offer. Always be on your guard.

This is an RPG quest from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

Objective:
return the Chalice of Reversal to Thadon

Tasks:
find the Chalice of Reversal

Quest-giver:
Thadon, Duke of Mania, a Felldew addict

Items:
Chalice of Reversal: a chalice that makes the world a much brighter and happier place after eating Felldew
Felldew: an addictive drug

Facts:
Thadon is inebriated from withdrawal effects of Felldew

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
Ahh yes, THERE you are! You couldn't imagine how long I, Thadon, the Duke of Mania, have been waiting for you. So little to do, and so much time. Hmm, could you, in fact, imagine just how long I've been waiting? I don't think you could, but I might be wrong.
It felt like rather a long time, but then long times get longer when you're standing around thinking about them. A curious thing, that. Long roads get longer too, if you're thinking about them, but what about long words? They don't change nearly as much. Long, short -- it all ends up the same. Dust and tears. Usually tears first, then the dust. Dust can't cry, you see. That would be... well, amusing. You know what's NOT amusing? I don't have my Chalice of Reversal. It makes me sad. When I get sad, I don't care to do much of anything. I certainly don't care to help people who show up on my doorstep wanting something. Are we getting the picture here?
The Chalice of Reversal is one of my favorite toys. Does wonders for creativity. Well, not by itself, but it helps. Is this making sense? Look, you eat the Felldew, then use the chalice, and find the world a much brighter and happier place. Honest. But I don't have it. So I can't eat Felldew, because that would just be bad. I mean, really bad. Find my chalice!

Adamus Phillida does not tolerate Dark Brotherhood operations within the Imperial City

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
In the Imperial City there lives a High Elf who must be removed from existence. Finding this person may prove... challenging. Are you interested?
Your target is a High Elf named Faelian. He lives somewhere in the Imperial City, and fancies long walks. Unfortunately, that's all we know. We don't know which district he calls home, which establishments he frequents, or anything about his schedule.
This contract will require a bit of detective work. I suggest you to speak to your fellow Brothers and Sisters and see if they can offer any advice. Ah yes, there is one more thing. The Imperial City is also home to an Imperial Legion captain named Adamus Phillida. Phillida has dedicated his life to eradicating the Dark Brotherhood. He will not tolerate our operations within the Imperial City.
When that happens, he tends to make our lives uncomfortable. Let's not give the good captain any reason to go poking around in our affairs, hmm? If possible, do away with Faelian someplace out of the way. Definitely indoors, with no other people around. A secure location, with no witnesses. This will make it look like a simple murder. Phillida will be none the wiser, and you'll receive a nice bonus.
Now go, and may the Reaper of Souls go with you.

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
I've figured out another item needed for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise. The second item is the counterpart to the first: the blood of a Divine.
This was a terrible puzzle to me. Unlike the Daedra, the gods have no artifacts, and do not physically manifest themselves in our world.
How then to obtain the blood of a god? But Jauffre solved it. The blood of Tiber Septim himself, who became one of the Divines. This is a secret remembered only by the Blades, passed down from one Grandmaster to the next.
Jauffre should tell it to you himself.

I hired the crew to sail to Summerset Isle to retrieve a family heirloom, my mother's crystal ball. They made the journey, and arrived back all right, but then... Someone murdered them! All of them!

If you bring them to me when you find them, I will pay you double for each one.

collect 10 samples of Nirnroot for Sinderion

a discount for buying more Elixir of Exploration from Sinderion

Items:
10 Nirnroot: a rare root plant
Elixir of Exploration: a multi-purpose potion for dungeon explorers
Imperial Alchemy Symposium: a convention for alchemists

Facts:
the player has brought Sinderion a sample of Nirnroot for examination
the Elixir of Exploration requires Nirnroot
the formula for the Elixir of Exploration describes many magnitudes of the brew: Sinderion wrote a short missive about it for the Imperial Alchemy Symposium

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
So, you've brought something for me to examine?
Yes, this is a genuine Nirnroot sample. Very nice quality in fact. Hmmm... that gives me an idea. Since you already know what they look like, do you feel up to a bit of a collecting expedition?
A few years ago, an adventurer not unlike yourself sold me a musty old tome containing alchemical formulas. Most of them were worthless. But one of the moldy pages contained the recipe for a potion known as an Elixir of Exploration, a sort of "ultimate dungeon delver's" brew. The formula looked sound, except it required an extremely rare ingredient. Yes, you guessed it, the Nirnroot. I put the book aside, because frankly, I had so many other delicate experiments going on that I just didn't have the time to go plant hunting. Now that you're here, that changes things.
The Elixir of Exploration is a multi-purpose potion that was obviously created with the dungeon explorer in mind. The formula describes many magnitudes of the brew. If you're interested, I wrote a short missive about it for the Imperial Alchemy Symposium. You bring me 10 samples of Nirnroot, and I'll make the Elixir of Exploration available to you at a huge discount as well as give you one for free.
The best place for you to start would be Shadeleaf Copse, which is a part of the Great Forest northeast of here. Good luck, and hurry back with more of the Nirnroot!

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
Thank goodness someone that can help is here! I don't know how to make this request any simpler, but to put it bluntly, Raelynn the Gravefinder must die.
A few months ago, that witch of a Necromancer decided to inhabit Moss Rock Cavern just north of my inn. I don't know what she does in there; frankly, I don't want to know. However, I do know that after she arrived, the woods at night became unsafe.
I've seen undead of all types walking in the dark woods near the cave entrance. Now, this area's getting a bad reputation and my business has waned. Every day, it seems the number of undead increase.
If someone can get into the cave and kill Raelynn, maybe we can stem the tide. Her death pays a handsome bounty. I hope you'll take advantage of the opportunity. Raelynn will finally get what's coming to her.

the drawing on the bottom of the page Umbacano gave the player depicts a carved panel from the central chamber of the High Fane
Umbacano gives the player the key to the inner chamber of the High Fane

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
You have proven yourself more than a simple grave robber. I believe you can handle a more complicated assignment. Are you interested?
Here, take a look at this sketch. The ancient texts refer to this site only as the "High Fane." Do you know it? Your first task is to locate the ruins of the High Fane. I believe it must now be known by a different name.
The High Fane dates from the Late Ayleid Period, following the fall of White Gold Tower, a very troubled time for that ancient people. A time I find most fascinating. The drawing on the bottom of the page I gave you depicts a carved panel from the central chamber of the High Fane. I believe this carving will shed new light on Ayleid history, if I am able to examine it closely. I would like you to retrieve it for me.
You will need this as well. It is the key to the inner chamber of the High Fane. I part with it reluctantly, so guard it well. It is what began my search for the High Fane, many years ago.

Use this spell on the Countess and her guests. I think it will make the party much more interesting. You should probably try to be inconspicuous. Or they might kill you. Oh, and the party is by invitation only. You'll have to find a way in.
Have fun!

Roland Jenseric's house in the Temple District of the Imperial City

Quest-giver:
Seridur, an elderly vampire hunter, and the leader of the Order of the Virtuous Blood, located at the sanctuary of the Order of the Virtuous Blood in the Imperial City

Characters:
Roland Jenseric, a male vampire

Groups:
Order of the Virtuous Blood: an order of vampire hunters, who defend the Imperial City from vampires

Locations:
Imperial City: a large city

Facts:
the player is a famous hero: the player has not met Seridur before
Seridur and his fellow vampire hunters are only 3 old men lacking the strength to defeat vampires in battle
Roland killed his girlfriend in the back garden of his house by sucking her blood out of her neck
the player should return to the sanctuary of the Order of the Virtuous Blood if they have questions: the Order of the Virtuous Blood meet at night

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
It's an honor to finally meet you. When I heard you were in town, I just had to send for your help. Your reputation precedes you. Oh, allow me to introduce myself. I am Seridur.
Welcome. You're now in the sanctuary of the Order of the Virtuous Blood. Few outside our circle have ever set foot in our hallowed hall. We are, for lack of a better word, defenders. We guard this city from an infestation that plagues it. We are vampire hunters. I'm sure you are familiar with those despicable beings. Feeding on the innocent as if they were cattle. Well, this group was formed to combat them. Alas, we are but 3 old men, not able to match the fighting prowess of the vampire. We lack the strength to defeat them in battle.
Our goal is to root out the vampires that live in our fair city. So far, we've been unsuccessful finding one until now. It's come to the Order's attention that Temple District resident Roland Jenseric is a vampire, and has already claimed one victim. That's where you come in. We want you to slay this vampire and cleanse the city of his filth before he can feed or kill again.
A few nights ago, I was roaming the city as I often do, looking for any signs of a vampire. As I headed past Roland's house I heard a cry. I rushed into the back garden to find Roland struggling with a woman he'd been courting. I tried to intervene, but he was too strong. He threw his lover to the ground and turned his attention on me. Luckily, I managed to run back into the street and escape his grasp. I hid for a while and then returned to the garden. Roland was gone and the woman was dead. She had two puncture marks on the nape of her neck. That's when I realized he was a vampire. The Order needs you to track him and destroy him.
I would start by searching his home. He hasn't been there for days, so it should be safe. Return to us here if you have questions. We meet at night.

The name's Ralis. Ralis Sedarys, out of Mournhold.
I've got a financier waiting for me back on the mainland. Sent me here in the interests of obtaining some rare antiquities. The 'Relics of Ahzidal.' But this whole thing became a disaster right quick, let me tell you.
You come out to the northern ashlands, you don't expect things to go easy, you know? But this was something outside my particular expertise. When I first got to Kolbjorn, you couldn't even see it. Buried in the ash, like most other things on this blasted island. Dug out a pile of the stuff taller than me just to find the barrow. Who knows how much to reach the door. Excavating isn't exactly my specialty. Even if it was, the ash storms fill it in faster than you can dig.
Could you become my business partner? We can sort out the details of our little arrangement later, but for now, I'll manage the dig if you can manage the coin.
When you have 1,000 gold for me, I'll head back to Raven Rock and round up some diggers. Once we've got something worth looking at, I'll send word to you.

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
I've been working on something. An improvement on the Ebonyflesh spell. I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help.
I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough. My knowledge of history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.
First, there are ancient references to dragon "heartscales". What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need. Second, there are stories of a dagger called Kahvozein's Fang, said to be sharp enough to carve heartscales off a dragon.
First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few heartscales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.
If my research succeeds, I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the Dragonhide spell tome.

So I got arrested for his murder. And now I have to stare at these bars for eight months. Can you believe it?

Find her and I promise you'll be well compensated. Svidi was a young woman... buxom, with long flowing black hair. She used to sing the most lovely songs to me when we were courting. I've never heard a voice so beautiful.

purify a soul gem

Tasks:
place the soul gem in 3 Dwarven Convectors and heat them for 3 seconds with Arniel Gane's spell

Task locations:
Skyrim ruins

Quest-giver:
Arniel Gane, a scholar fascinated by the Dwemer

Items:
3 Dwarven Convectors, Convectors: Dwemer machines that were used to purify gems

Groups:
Dwemer: a lost race of people, masters of magic

Locations:
Skyrim: a realm

Facts:
the Dwemer's greatest achievement has also been their greatest mystery: their instant, unexplainable disappearance
Arniel Gane tries to find out what happened to the Dwemer though experimentation
the player brought Arniel Gane Dwemer parts and a soul gem before

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
The Dwemer, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of. Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... mystery.
This mystery is their disappearance, of course! Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened. After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation.
Only now... Well, it's simply a disaster. Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event. I used the soul gem you brought me for this. The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The Dwemer had machines for this sort of thing. I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own Dwemer machine. It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.
The designs for my Convector were based on real Dwemer machines, so there may still be some in existence. I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations. Perhaps you could seek out these Convectors in Skyrim ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.
Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the Convector. At least three seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple Convectors. I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.
But, ahh... It's effective. Three times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?

I left that one in Windhelm at the White Phial alchemy shop. It was a good trade too. Ah well.

Obeying the Night Mother. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense. Cicero may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the Night Mother.

I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life! But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right. After the attack, Arnbjorn flew into a rage. When Cicero left... Arnbjorn went after him. They disappeared into the wild. Take my horse, Shadowmere. You'll find him outside, by the pool, when you go find Arnbjorn. Search Cicero's room here. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.
Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to Veezara, and calm everyone down.

This is an RPG quest from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

Objective:
restore the Gildergreen with the sap of the Eldergleam

Tasks:
get Nettlebane

Task locations:
Orphan Rock, a Hagraven nest

Quest-giver:
Danica Pure-Spring, a priestess of Kynareth, located at the Gildergreen in Whiterun

Characters:
Kynareth, the goddess of nature

Items:
Gildergreen: the big holy tree of Kynareth that died
Eldergleam: the ancient parent tree of the Gildergreen
Nettlebane: a weapon that can cut the Eldergleam

Groups:
Hagravens: old, bird-like hags

Locations:
Whiterun: a city

Facts:
disciples of Kynareth used to travel far to hear the winds of Kynareth in the Gildergreen's branches

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
This is the Gildergreen. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of Whiterun. Disciples of Kynareth could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. Of course, not as many pilgrims these days. A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains. Kynareth gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.
I've thought about restoring the Gildergreen... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber. I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, Eldergleam, we could wake up its child. But even if you could get to the Eldergleam, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal. If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first.
Eldergleam is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic. You'll have to deal with the Hagravens. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing Kynareth's creations. It's called "Nettlebane." The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself. It's held in a Hagraven nest called Orphan Rock

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
By the almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful Black Sacrament thing... it worked.
Well, I won't waste your time. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experienced in, well, centuries.
As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied. I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable. But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target. The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of... ...the Emperor.
What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the Dark Brotherhood. This is... what you do? No? You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned. But I digress. Here, take these two items. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior. The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.

For now, I need Nikulas here. You see, his father, my husband, was recently lost to us. Nikulas is all that I have left in this world. I know it is selfish of me to say so, but I cannot lose him. Not while I still grieve. Also, I know his heart. Nikulas is reckless and foolish, like most young men. He cannot understand what awaits him in the wide world.
