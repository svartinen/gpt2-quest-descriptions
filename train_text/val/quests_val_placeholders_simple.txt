This is an RPG quest from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

Objective:
return the item_0 to quest_giver

Tasks:
find the item_0

Quest-giver:
quest_giver, Duke of Mania, a item_1 addict

Items:
item_0: a chalice that makes the world a much brighter and happier place after eating item_1
item_1: an addictive drug

Facts:
quest_giver is inebriated from withdrawal effects of item_1

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
Ahh yes, THERE you are! You couldn't imagine how long I, quest_giver, the Duke of Mania, have been waiting for you. So little to do, and so much time. Hmm, could you, in fact, imagine just how long I've been waiting? I don't think you could, but I might be wrong.
It felt like rather a long time, but then long times get longer when you're standing around thinking about them. A curious thing, that. Long roads get longer too, if you're thinking about them, but what about long words? They don't change nearly as much. Long, short -- it all ends up the same. Dust and tears. Usually tears first, then the dust. Dust can't cry, you see. That would be... well, amusing. You know what's NOT amusing? I don't have my item_0. It makes me sad. When I get sad, I don't care to do much of anything. I certainly don't care to help people who show up on my doorstep wanting something. Are we getting the picture here?
The item_0 is one of my favorite toys. Does wonders for creativity. Well, not by itself, but it helps. Is this making sense? Look, you eat the item_1, then use the chalice, and find the world a much brighter and happier place. Honest. But I don't have it. So I can't eat item_1, because that would just be bad. I mean, really bad. Find my chalice!

In the task_location_0 there lives a High Elf who must be removed from existence. Finding this person may prove... challenging. Are you interested?
Your target is a High Elf named character_0. He lives somewhere in the task_location_0, and fancies long walks. Unfortunately, that's all we know. We don't know which district he calls home, which establishments he frequents, or anything about his schedule.
This contract will require a bit of detective work. I suggest you to speak to your fellow Brothers and Sisters and see if they can offer any advice. Ah yes, there is one more thing. The task_location_0 is also home to an Imperial Legion captain named character_1. character_1 has dedicated his life to eradicating the group_0. He will not tolerate our operations within the task_location_0.
When that happens, he tends to make our lives uncomfortable. Let's not give the good captain any reason to go poking around in our affairs, hmm? If possible, do away with character_0 someplace out of the way. Definitely indoors, with no other people around. A secure location, with no witnesses. This will make it look like a simple murder. character_1 will be none the wiser, and you'll receive a nice bonus.
Now go, and may the Reaper of Souls go with you.

I've figured out another item needed for the ritual to open the portal to Camoran's Paradise. The second item is the counterpart to the first: the blood of a group_1.
This was a terrible puzzle to me. Unlike the group_2, the gods have no artifacts, and do not physically manifest themselves in our world.
How then to obtain the blood of a god? But character_0 solved it. The blood of character_1 himself, who became one of the group_1. This is a secret remembered only by the group_0, passed down from one Grandmaster to the next.

This is a travesty. A complete and utter travesty. The crystal ball is just sitting there in the hold, but I'll be damned if I'm going back onboard. And nobody will help me. Nobody! Not with those spirits roaming the decks. I don't suppose you'll help me? No, of course you won't...

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
So, you've brought something for me to examine?
Yes, this is a genuine item_0 sample. Very nice quality in fact. Hmmm... that gives me an idea. Since you already know what they look like, do you feel up to a bit of a collecting expedition?
A few years ago, an adventurer not unlike yourself sold me a musty old tome containing alchemical formulas. Most of them were worthless. But one of the moldy pages contained the recipe for a potion known as an item_1, a sort of "ultimate dungeon delver's" brew. The formula looked sound, except it required an extremely rare ingredient. Yes, you guessed it, the item_0. I put the book aside, because frankly, I had so many other delicate experiments going on that I just didn't have the time to go plant hunting. Now that you're here, that changes things.
The item_1 is a multi-purpose potion that was obviously created with the dungeon explorer in mind. The formula describes many magnitudes of the brew. If you're interested, I wrote a short missive about it for the item_2. You bring me number_0 samples of item_0, and I'll make the item_1 available to you at a huge discount as well as give you one for free.
The best place for you to start would be task_location_0, which is a part of the Great Forest northeast of here. Good luck, and hurry back with more of the item_0!

A few months ago, that witch of a Necromancer decided to inhabit task_location_0 just north of my inn. I don't know what she does in there; frankly, I don't want to know. However, I do know that after she arrived, the woods at night became unsafe.
I've seen undead of all types walking in the dark woods near the cave entrance. Now, this area's getting a bad reputation and my business has waned. Every day, it seems the number of undead increase.
If someone can get into the cave and kill character_0, maybe we can stem the tide. Her death pays a handsome bounty. I hope you'll take advantage of the opportunity. character_0 will finally get what's coming to her.

You have proven yourself more than a simple grave robber. I believe you can handle a more complicated assignment. Are you interested?
Here, take a look at this sketch. The ancient texts refer to this site only as the "location_0." Do you know it? Your first task is to locate the ruins of the location_0. I believe it must now be known by a different name.
The location_0 dates from the Late group_0 Period, following the fall of White Gold Tower, a very troubled time for that ancient people. A time I find most fascinating. The drawing on the bottom of the page I gave you depicts a carved panel from the central chamber of the location_0. I believe this carving will shed new light on group_0 history, if I am able to examine it closely. I would like you to retrieve it for me.
You will need this as well. It is the key to the inner chamber of the location_0. I part with it reluctantly, so guard it well. It is what began my search for the location_0, many years ago.

quest_giver and his fellow vampire hunters are only number_0 old men lacking the strength to defeat vampires in battle
character_0 killed his girlfriend in the back garden of his house by sucking her blood out of her neck
the player should return to the sanctuary of the group_0 if they have questions: the group_0 meet at night

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
It's an honor to finally meet you. When I heard you were in town, I just had to send for your help. Your reputation precedes you. Oh, allow me to introduce myself. I am quest_giver.
Welcome. You're now in the sanctuary of the group_0. Few outside our circle have ever set foot in our hallowed hall. We are, for lack of a better word, defenders. We guard this city from an infestation that plagues it. We are vampire hunters. I'm sure you are familiar with those despicable beings. Feeding on the innocent as if they were cattle. Well, this group was formed to combat them. Alas, we are but number_0 old men, not able to match the fighting prowess of the vampire. We lack the strength to defeat them in battle.
Our goal is to root out the vampires that live in our fair city. So far, we've been unsuccessful finding one until now. It's come to the Order's attention that Temple District resident character_0 is a vampire, and has already claimed one victim. That's where you come in. We want you to slay this vampire and cleanse the city of his filth before he can feed or kill again.
A few nights ago, I was roaming the city as I often do, looking for any signs of a vampire. As I headed past character_0's house I heard a cry. I rushed into the back garden to find character_0 struggling with a woman he'd been courting. I tried to intervene, but he was too strong. He threw his lover to the ground and turned his attention on me. Luckily, I managed to run back into the street and escape his grasp. I hid for a while and then returned to the garden. character_0 was gone and the woman was dead. She had two puncture marks on the nape of her neck. That's when I realized he was a vampire. The Order needs you to track him and destroy him.
I would start by searching his home. He hasn't been there for days, so it should be safe. Return to us here if you have questions. We meet at night.

You come out to the northern ashlands, you don't expect things to go easy, you know? But this was something outside my particular expertise. When I first got to location_0, you couldn't even see it. Buried in the ash, like most other things on this blasted island. Dug out a pile of the stuff taller than me just to find the barrow. Who knows how much to reach the door. Excavating isn't exactly my specialty. Even if it was, the ash storms fill it in faster than you can dig.
Could you become my business partner? We can sort out the details of our little arrangement later, but for now, I'll manage the dig if you can manage the coin.
When you have number_1 gold for me, I'll head back to location_3 and round up some diggers. Once we've got something worth looking at, I'll send word to you.

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
I've been working on something. An improvement on the item_1 spell. I've made progress, but then hit a snag. I think perhaps you could help.
I made some progress using the essence of dragon scales. But they're just not quite potent enough. My knowledge of history is far from complete, but I did some research and discovered two things.
First, there are ancient references to dragon "heartscales". What little I could learn suggests they may be what I need. Second, there are stories of a dagger called item_2, said to be sharp enough to carve heartscales off a dragon.
First you'll need to retrieve the dagger, then use it to carve a few heartscales off a dragon. Presumably a deceased one.
If my research succeeds, I certainly think you deserve the first copy of the item_0 spell tome.

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
Please, our tribe suffers and we need help.
Our Chief, character_0, was once a strong and proud warrior. Now he is stricken, cursed. He is weak, and so our tribe is weak. The giants sense this, and intrude on our territory. Now they assault our very home.
character_0 refuses help, but I sense that you may be just what we need. He has demanded we stay inside the walls. We cannot leave. I must petition character_1 for relief. This curse must be lifted. But I cannot travel to character_1's shrine. The ritual must be done here, and I do not have the materials I need.
I beg of you, can you bring me item_0 and a item_1? I have no wish to depend on a stranger, but I have no choice.

Locations:
location_0: a realm

Facts:
the group_0's greatest achievement has also been their greatest mystery: their instant, unexplainable disappearance
quest_giver tries to find out what happened to the group_0 though experimentation
the player brought quest_giver group_0 parts and a soul gem before

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
The group_0, they were uhh, masters of magic in a way we can't even begin to conceive of. Their greatest achievement, however, has also been their greatest, shall we say... mystery.
This mystery is their disappearance, of course! Instant, unexplainable. The stories have fascinated me... Ever since I was young, I wanted to know what really happened. After years and years of work, I'm closing in on a way to investigate what happened through experimentation.
Only now... Well, it's simply a disaster. Without boring you with the, ahh, details, I am attempting to re-create the circumstances of the event. I used the soul gem you brought me for this. The soul gem by itself isn't enough, you see. It needs to be altered, purified. The group_0 had machines for this sort of thing. I attempted to build my own, based on designs and using parts you helped to provide. My very own group_0 machine. It worked, but not fully. And the uhh... The device was destroyed in the process.
The designs for my item_0_1 were based on real group_0 machines, so there may still be some in existence. I'd go looking myself, but uhh... Yes, there are calculations to double- and triple-check. Many calculations. Perhaps you could seek out these item_0_1 in location_0 ruins? I can even teach you the spell to heat them.
Just place the soul gem inside, and heat the item_0_1. At least number_0 seconds. You'll almost certainly need to find multiple item_0_1. I suspect it may be due to the nature of the soul gem versus the crystals this was intended for. Destroys the equipment in the process.
But, ahh... It's effective. number_0 times, and the crystal should be ready for the next step. Isn't this exciting?

I paid character_0 half the cost of character_1 up front, but before he could deliver, character_2 had him locked up. character_0 believes this exempts him from our deal. It does not.
Head to the task_location_0 and talk to character_0. Get him to tell you where character_1 and his Lineage Papers are and bring them to me outside location_0. You'll be well paid for your time.

The fool character_0 went absolutely berserk! He wounded character_2, tried to kill me, and then he fled. I knew that lunatic couldn't be trusted.
Nothing set character_0 off. At least nothing I'm aware of. Well... If I'm being honest, I haven't exactly been discreet lately in expressing my frustration with this whole situation. Obeying the character_1. You being the Listener. It's ridiculous. No offense. character_0 may have overheard me talking to one of the others about the character_1. It's possible I was... not entirely respectful. But to go this far. To attempt to murder the leader of a Sanctuary. character_0 must pay with his life. There is no other option.
I want you to find that miserable little fool and end his life! But first... find my husband. Make sure he's all right. After the attack, character_4 flew into a rage. When character_0 left... character_4 went after him. They disappeared into the wild. Take my horse, character_3. You'll find him outside, by the pool, when you go find character_4. Search character_0's room here. Maybe there's something in there that sheds some light on where he might have gone.
Let me know the minute you find something. I've got to see to character_2, and calm everyone down.

Locations:
location_0: a city

Facts:
disciples of character_0 used to travel far to hear the winds of character_0 in the item_0's branches

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
This is the item_0. It was planted as a seedling in the early years of location_0. Disciples of character_0 could sense something holy in it, and traveled far to hear the winds of the goddess in its branches. Of course, not as many pilgrims these days. A big dead tree isn't very inspiring if you're coming to worship the divine of wind and rains. character_0 gives life, and we need a living tree to be her symbol.
I've thought about restoring the item_0... Trees like this never really die. They only slumber. I think if we had some of the sap from the parent tree, item_1, we could wake up its child. But even if you could get to the item_1, you couldn't tap it. Not with any normal metal. If you want to help, you'll need something to cut into it first.
item_1 is older than metal, from a time before men or elves. To even affect it, you have to tap into the old magic. You'll have to deal with the group_0. I've heard about a weapon they've made for sacrificing character_0's creations. It's called "item_2." The hags terrify me, or I would have gone after it myself. It's held in a group_0 nest called task_location_0

Quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
By the almighty Divines. You've come. You've actually come. This dreadful item_0 thing... it worked.
Well, I won't waste your time. I would like to arrange a contract. Several, actually. I daresay, the work I'm offering has more significance than anything your organization has experienced in, well, centuries.
As I said, I want you to kill several people. You'll find the targets, as well as their manners of elimination, quite varied. I'm sure someone of your disposition will probably even find it enjoyable. But you should know that these killings are but a means to an end. For they pave the way to the most important target. The real reason I'm speaking with a cutthroat in the bowels of this detestable crypt. For I seek the assassination of... ...the Emperor.
What I ask is no small thing, of course. But you represent the group_0. This is... what you do? No? You must understand. So much has led to this day. So much planning, and maneuvering. Now, it's as if the very stars have finally aligned. But I digress. Here, take these two items. They need to be delivered to your, um... superior. The sealed letter will explain everything that needs to be done. The amulet is quite valuable - you can use it to pay for any and all expenses.

For now, I need character_0 here. You see, his father, my husband, was recently lost to us. character_0 is all that I have left in this world. I know it is selfish of me to say so, but I cannot lose him. Not while I still grieve. Also, I know his heart. character_0 is reckless and foolish, like most young men.
