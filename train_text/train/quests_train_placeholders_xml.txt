HELLO! SHHH! Shh... ah... um... I mean, hello.
Might I have but a moment of your, ah, time? I should like to procure your talents for a, ah, unique service, though it's not like you would have to do anything socially untoward. Okay, it's stealing, but it's only the one item: A wondrously curious little toy from distant land. What did they call it? Oh, yes, a "telescope," of all things. It's a misleading name for such an interestingly crafted artifact. "Golden Extra-Farseer" would have suited its craftsmanship so much better. The tele-thingy is on display at the task_location_0, and were it in the possession of anyone else it might be purchasable. It's roguery on par with character_0, and I don't want anybody hurt.
I'll pay you well: number_0 gold for one night's work. It's better than you could hope for in a year on the docks!

Pleasure to meet you. The name's quest_giver.
I'm from down south, where the Cloud Peaks tumble into the sea. A pair of sirines has been trying to move into the area. They sank my fishing boat and put me right out of work. *sigh* If they weren't so dang beautiful, it would be a lot easier to convince people of how much of a nuisance they can be. Can you kill them for me? It's a dirty deed but it's the cost of civilization, isn't it?

I am quest_giver, though I thank you not to mention that too often.
A local wizard by the name of character_0 makes his home in a moored group_1 skyship. It would appear that he has the knowledge to reproduce these flying marvels and is currently organizing the sale of the recipe to character_1. He has drawn up a set of rituals and has procured an artifact fragment and an ancient statuette vital to the spell that keeps the ships aloft. These he has divided amongst his daughters until the deal is to proceed. I have been contacted by a representative of the group_1, and they have no wish to see scores of flying ships manufactured in every port. You are to infiltrate the place of exchange that is known as task_location_0, steal the ingredients, and return here with them. Simple enough.
You would be well paid. Enough gold to give you a backache and, if I am well pleased, mayhaps a magical weapon or two. Perhaps a little more, perhaps a little less. It entirely depends upon your performance.

I was the guide for character_0's brave adventures to the ends of the world and beyond. The wolf-men are everywhere. The lycanthropes' lair is in character_0's ship. My spellbook lies within. With it, I am a powerful mage. Without it, I am the pauper that stands before you. With my spellbook retrieved, I may be able to discover a way off of the island.
If you go to destroy the lycanthropes' lair, I would ask that you find my book.

It is I, quest_giver, second-in-command of the group_0. I have another job you might be interested in. You'll be well paid for your services.
The problem is this: Every night people have been disappearing from the streets of the city. My men have been scouring the city trying to find the culprit, but so far to no avail. People have begun to get scared, and very few are willing to leave their homes at night. Something has to be done, and quickly. Would you be willing to take the job? I'd pay you number_0 gold in advance with a number_1 gold bonus if you discover what's been happening with the disappearing citizens.
Your job is really simple. All I want you to do is patrol the east of the city and find an entrance to the sewers. Perhaps you'll get lucky and find out what's been happening. If you do find out what's been happening, come to see me at the group_0 barracks. Our only clue so far has led us to the sewers, so if you want to explore them first, it would probably be a good idea. Also, we've found tracks of some many-legged creature, perhaps a centipede-like monster.

<|begin_description|>
It is so pleasant to see your face once again. Don't you recognize me? It is I, quest_giver. I am so glad to have met you, especially at a time like this. I need to speak with you privately.
I'm sorry for all of this hiding and skulking, but there are dire events afoot. You know that I am one of the principal shareholders of the group_0. Well, I share ownership of the company with two others: character_0_0 and character_0_1, two very distinguished gentlemen. When I returned from my hunting trip — thanks to you, I might add — I found that my two partners had undergone some profound changes, nothing physical or overt, but something far more sinister.
It's as if my partners had become wholly different people while I was gone. They almost take an active interest in squandering our company's resources on frivolous and stupid ideas. If they continue on this course, the company will be in shambles in but a few weeks. I know you have already helped me once, but I ask for your assistance again. I have no other recourse.
Come into the group_0 Estate with me. I will explain that you are an old friend of mine and will quarter you in the guest chambers. From there, please investigate my partners, perhaps using magic or any of the other skills you possess. Learn as much as you can during your visit and then report back to me after you're done. It should only take a couple of days.

You've come here to fight ankhegs? Well, listen up: it's mating season, so it's primarily females coming up to the surface, looking to put on a little extra weight. They're hungry, they're aggressive, and there are a lot of them. Now, the point of this exercise is not to exterminate them, but to keep their population to a manageable level. Remember, they aerate the soil and thereby improve crop yields by as much as 15%. Food is going to be scarce enough in the next few years, so keep that in mind when you're out there. No more than number_0 ankhegs per party. After that it's catch and release, all right? Most of the activity starts about fifty yards to the east.
Now move out, everyone. You'll get number_1 gold pieces, if you stick to the quota.

Well, I have a proposal that could help you in that endeavor. You see, there's a girl, my lover in fact, who desires to escape her father and live on her own. Her father is character_1, one of the dukes of task_location_0. This, of course, makes her desires more difficult than that of the average city girl.
However, with your assistance, we could help her escape the tyrannical clutches of character_1. Here's the punchline: Since character_1's going to be hunting us anyway, we can blackmail him for hoards of cash and not worry about our captive escaping. After all, we're doing it all for the sake of character_0.
Now, we needn't go about this right away. In fact, I'll help you with whatever you're doing until you decide to head up to task_location_0. Just think of it as one favor deserving another.

Hail, adventurers. I'm quest_giver, and I work for character_0. She's the most skilled musician and actor along the location_0. 
I have a proposal for you. How would you like a well-paying job as a bodyguard for my mistress? She's been having some problems of late. Some thugs have been hired by character_1 to hurt her bad because she didn't perform at his inn when she was supposed to. You can't blame her for not showing up, what with a villain like character_1 running the place.
Just meet me outside of the location_1, if you are interested in the job.

Forgive me. My name is quest_giver. character_0 and I have watched over this area for years, and we never had any trouble with goblins before. Since they killed her, I've been half out of my mind with grief.

<|end_tools|>
<|begin_description|>
First of all, my name is quest_giver. I have been on the lookout for skilled adventurers. My task is very simple.
Some years ago, an evil band of mercenaries were all petrified while trying to break into the home of character_0. For those of you with a limited vocabulary, petrified means "turned to stone." Anyhow, one of those adventurers had in his possession an item of power: the item_0. character_0 didn't know this at the time and so, after turning them all to stone, he simply sold their bodies to an art collector living in the heart of location_0.
What I would like you to do is find these statues, turn them back to flesh, and take the item. I will give you these six scrolls of stone to flesh. Use them on the statues when you find them.
The estate can be found just west of the fairgrounds in the center of town. Good luck, and don't entertain any thoughts about betraying me. It could be very hazardous to your health.
You will be paid number_0 gold for this service. This is a kingly sum, so I won't barter with you about the amount.

<|begin_description|>
First off, let me introduce myself. I'm quest_giver, second-in-command of the group_1.
I need you to begin an investigation of the group_0 trading coster. The group_0 leadership has been acting strangely of late. They've been selling off valuable assets and neglecting many of their more profitable trading ventures. Considering the importance that the trading coster holds over the economy of the city, the group_2 are noticeably upset. I've gone to talk to the coster's head, character_0. He rudely rebuffed me, telling me to mind my own business. I've known character_0 for many years, and this isn't his usual behavior. I can't start up an official investigation, as there is no real reason for doing so. That's why I need you.
I want you to break into the group_0 compound and find out what's wrong. Use stealth in your investigations; I don't want this operation to cause too much fuss. The most important person to watch for is character_0.
Once you've found out as much as possible, report back to me at the group_1 compound.
I'll pay you number_0 gold for this favor.

Greetings, adventurer. I have, or perhaps I should say had, a son named character_0. He fell in with a crew of adventurers from Waterdeep. character_0 was always obsessed with the idea of being a hero.
Alas, he has neither the brains nor the ability. Such is a mother's lot in life, however, to watch her children perform acts of idiocy despite her warnings or concerns.
He and his thick-skulled cohorts took it upon themselves to plumb the depths of task_location_0. They bought a ward token from that shyster, character_1, and made ready to leave. Though I begged and cried, character_0 still insisted on going. The band never returned. I fear that they were destroyed by the mad dwarf's machinations. That is the tale, sad but true.

The deal is this: I've been hired out by the mayor of location_0 to hunt down a great winged dragon that's been plaguing the caravan routes. He's offered number_0 gold for its head. Now before you get cold feet, let me allay your fears. The only descriptions of the beast have always mentioned its deadly barbed tail. From what I know about dragons they don't have barbs on their tails — that's something unique to enemy_0. So all we have to do is find this enemy_0's nest and kill it.

I am quest_giver, a mere guard.
I saw what happened, and I share your helplessness. Any complaints about character_0 must first go THROUGH him, so you can imagine how many get through.
This did not come from me, for if my indiscretion against character_0 were to get out, I should be thrown from the military. There is one way you can get to him.
character_0 is quite corrupt and more than willing to exercise his power. You are not monitored as we, so you can do something that I or another guard cannot.
Look to the docks and a man named character_2. Examine him and what he does, and you are sure to see what I mean. You might also wish to pry into character_0's personal records. They may reveal something of his fondness for gems. I did not tell you this... and I certainly did not say his records are in his home northwest of the main government building in the Government District.
Think on what I've said, and bring anything you learn to character_1 in the Government District main building. He is character_0's commander.

<|begin_description|>
I should begin with my name... quest_giver. I grew up here in location_0.
Things have not always been like this. location_0 was once a pleasant town, though my memories may be influenced by happier times in my own life.
Then the pirates arrived, led by the despot character_3. character_3 had lost a war with another pirate king. Forced to this island, his ships invaded the town. They took our homes. character_3 killed our mayor and dumped his body into the sea. We were forced out into the streets.
My father could take no more injustice. He tried to get back into our house and was executed for breaking the law of the pirates. Once they've stolen something, the owner has no claim on it.
character_3 said that we would have to pay for our father's "crime." He gave us to character_2, his lieutenant, as a reward for service. He put me to work as a courtesan for the drunken pirates. It's horrible, traveler! He says that he'll kill my brother character_1 if I don't do it.
There is no escape for character_1 and me. There is a smuggler who will take us, but we cannot afford to pay him. There is nowhere to run on this island.
character_2 can be found near the inn. The smuggler's name is character_0. I hope that character_0 will take us with him when you kill character_2. He will be near the docks. Please be careful!

Greetings. It is quest_giver of the group_0 and I believe it is time for you to perform one final task, if you are willing.
There is an item, a holy artifact, that lies within the hands of a great evil. enemy_0, the great red dragon, looms over the task_location_0. His reign must end, and from his lair you must retrieve the most holy of blades, the reward_0. This tool of good has been in his possession for too long. Knight, I call upon you to slay the dragon and make a statement for right and justice.
The blade will be rescued, but so shall the lands that he rules. This is a great risk, but it must be dealt with sometime. Go, and may the forces of good be your salvation.
Accomplish this, and I can think of no one more worthy of wielding the reward_0. In your hands, such a blade will strike deep to evil's heart.

I'm quest_giver. I'm warning everyone so as to get the word out that there are guards on the streets. We've had a... a string of killings, and I don't want any more happening.
Bandits I can understand; they are easy enough to figure out. What's happening here is... it's murder, but not like I've ever seen. There's a disgustingly sick person out there, and I simply don't have the manpower to protect everyone. He's been killing paupers, sometimes in the alley where they sleep. They have nothing to take. He kills them and that is all. Not only is it pointless, but he does it in as painful a way as possible. It's... it's sick. He flays them... alive. There has been blood all over the area.
I must go about my rounds. If you find any information about the murders, be sure to let me know. Don't go looking for trouble though.

Hello once again!
It is pleasing to see that you did not respond to the call of that harlot, character_0 group_0. The woman is too deluded to see the truth, as I said. A commoner that has risen above her station. Our two houses have been feuding for generations. The group_0 seem to be possessed of the notion that their family founded this town... what an absurd thought!
Why they would even presume to suppose such a thing, I have no idea. It is sad, however, that the group_1 have never had the evidence to prove our claim to them... though it galls me that we would need it. All that has recently changed. An old tome belonging to my family states that there is proof — that proof can be found right here in location_0. In the graveyard is a tomb that has been long abandoned... but which also houses the founder of the town. My ancestor. With him lies a large circlet called the item_0.
Possessing that circlet would be all the proof I need, so I wish to acquire it. I would do so myself, but there happens to be a good reason the tomb is abandoned. It is... haunted, so they say. The exact nature of its danger I do not know... but you are a hero who surely could face its perils and return safely with the mantle, yes? In return, I shall pay you number_0 gold. I shall give you the key, then, which will allow you into the tomb... the key itself having been in my family for some time as well. More proof, yes? Go, then, and return with the mantle.

Ah! It is the hero of location_0, come to see me at last. I trust that all is well? That pig, character_0 group_1, did not speak too harshly about me, I trust? No matter. He is a stubborn, deluded fool. Our families have been at odds for generations, you see. The group_1 refuse to acknowledge the fact that we are the only true noble family in location_0, having founded it. Why they would think themselves higher than they are is beyond my ken. What is unfortunate, however, is that my family has never had actual, physical proof of the truth of our claim.
That has changed, however. A tome has recently been uncovered... an old tome belonging to my family... that states there is proof right here in location_0 under our noses. In the graveyard, here in town, lies the crypt of the founder... my ancestor. With him lies the item_0. A pretty name for an old gold circlet. That circlet, however, would prove my claim once and for all and shut those group_1 up. I would get it myself, but the tomb is haunted, you see. Here is the key to the tomb... the fact that we possess it is yet more proof of our legitimacy. Use it to enter and obtain the mantle, and then return to me when you are done.
You are a hero who might enter that tomb and retrieve the circlet for me, if you are willing. In return, I will pay you number_0 gold. What do you say, my hero?

I would like you to participate in a little rendezvous and help in the removal of a pest. There is a government official, character_0, causing us no end of trouble with his tariffs and spot checks on caravans. This fool thinks he can stifle the thieving trade of an entire city. He has been trying to muscle into a relationship with the group_0, and while we could pay, it is better that we send a message to any of his cohorts. I have come here with a promise of granting his wishes, but I only want to lure him away from his palisade defenses. This is where you come in.
character_0 wishes to be introduced to a contact here in the city, and that contact will be you. The meeting is already set up, and when he arrives, we will take him by surprise. You are known somewhat in this place, if not as a guildmaster. He will believe you are a legitimate contact. He seems willing to believe anything, so long as it is theatrical.
It will be any evening that is best for you. I will await you in task_location_0 after dark and then dispense a runner to get character_0. The suddenness will seem dramatic to him.

I know a few actors that aren't working, but it'll take some time to find them, as well as a worthy play to put into production. A week for that, I think. About six weeks after that for rehearsing and then this playhouse of yours should start making decent coin, so long as all goes well.

I... I cannot go anywhere like this! I can feel that magic, that evil, growing inside of me! Please, my noble savior... help me! Wh-when he was... taking my skin, the skin walker said the only way to stop the process was a spell of restoration. B-but he laughed, saying I would never receive it.

It is I, the spirit of the grove, child.
Child of nature, you are again needed. Balance is threatened, and Chaos is at the periphery. Will you serve the grove?
The grove is young in terms of nature and ancient in the years of man. Centuries ago, character_0 established a protectorate of nature in these woods. Now, as character_0 knew would someday happen, his descendants have returned and old enemies marshal their forces. A child called character_1 has recently arrived in task_location_0. This child is the inheritor of character_0's spirit, but does not yet have the knowledge to use his power. Surely he shall be slain by the forces of chaos if you do not rescue him. Even now he is alone and in danger, his parents slain by an evil that haunts him. You must find the child character_1 in task_location_0 and fight character_0's old enemies to save the child's life.
The spirit that once was character_0 has gone forth to aid the child... but the spirit is not the power that the man once was and cannot hope to hold out for long. Aid him lest all be lost.

character_0! That... that fat excuse for a slaver, he's cursed me! Damn him! If the curse was tailored to me, it might resist removal by normal means. I doubt character_0 would have done this if the solution were simple.
I have a few options. character_0 mentioned that he lived in squalor, suggesting he may be in the poor section of the city. Not likely to find him quick though. The mages with him wore odd colors that might be traceable. Ask at the government building, as all magic is regulated in location_0. If they will talk... He also mentioned character_1, a merchant that helped expose character_0. He frequents the task_location_0, and the bartender character_2 might know his whereabouts.

Now I ask for a more specific task that will disrupt the group_0 further.
The task is... unseemly.
It calls for the murder of a man. Not a truly innocent man, but hardly a villain of epic scope. You must kill, blaming the murder on the group_0. He is head of a merchant house, and his link to group_0 is blatant. If he were to die and certain gear were at the scene, it would implicate the guild we oppose.
Take this cloak and dagger, and go kill character_0. When he is dead, put the cloak and dagger in the fountain in his house. He will die easily, though there may be guards. His small house is in the Government District, between the jail and the government building.
Go.

The genies will allow no trade to occur until character_1 is found and her head given to them. Why... why they have chosen this particular tactic, I am unsure.
Without proper trade, however, the merchants are penniless. Soon, the food resources will dry up as well, so something must be done... and done soon.

My name is quest_giver, and I'm a very busy man right now.
A few days ago, someone opened a secret gate into the town — location_0 could easily have been overrun. We just discovered the traitor was a young man named character_0. There's no doubt in my mind that *someone* betrayed us. The enemy came through a small sewer outlet that was protected by both a locked iron grate and several powerful magical wards. There is no way to open that entrance from the outside. But character_0 is a faithful soldier, not the type of man to betray location_0.
An alarm was raised, and my soldiers arrived only a few moments after the gate was opened. We found three soldiers in the area: character_0, character_1, and the merchant character_2. We didn't get a chance to complete our investigations. character_1, the son of the character_3, disappeared. He was our primary witness. Our attention was focused on the vile character_2, but we had no proof. Then the countess told us that character_1, her son, had implicated character_0 before he disappeared.

character_1 demands proper tribute, and that occasionally means artwork pleasing to the eye. If a piece of his fury can be represented, more might see and fear it.
An artist visits task_location_0 now. The artist travels under the name character_0, though it is surely a fake. He is pretentious, demanding, and very good.
We must command a commission from him. But he is not being cooperative. His commission is outlandish, and he demands item_0 as his medium! He may as well have asked for dragon tears.
Convince him to work for character_1. Use whatever means you must. Other churches are trying the same... if you cross their representatives, kill them.
Incur what debts you must, and use force where it will help. Stop at nothing. This man must realize there is no choice but to work in the service of character_1.

So this wizard has stolen both away, and there is nothing we can do. I would ask that you return our character_0_1 and his gem to us both, by whatever means possible.
The wizard's name is character_1, I believe... I know that his lair can be accessed through the city's sewers, though where exactly it lies is a mystery.
We are but a destitute troupe of players, child, and can afford little. character_1 may have treasure of his own... Wrest it from his grasp if you wish to do so.

Go to the task_location_0 and find their hideout. There is a network of tombs beneath the graves where another spy tracked one of character_0's servants. There you shall find a set of blue doors just north of a spider den. The doors are too heavy for any mortal to open, but the vampires likely pass with ease. I shall send a mage to meet you there and arrange for the doors to be opened. Here, you shall need these stakes if you are to truly finish these creatures.
Be on your guard. This character_0 is the most intelligent and brutal foe I have ever had. If we are lax in our vigilance, we will be at the disadvantage. When you have destroyed their evil, return to me and I will fulfill our bargain.

Welcome to my humble accommodations, adventurer. Will you hear out my tale?
As I said before, my name is quest_giver... I hail from location_0 to the south, where I was a merchant. A successful one. I... suppose that is where I first came into contact with character_0.
character_0 is a lich, adventurer. A powerful one. In location_0, there are many strange wonders of magic, and character_0 is not out of place. It is he who has chased us here, hunting us mercilessly. character_0 desired my poor character_1, my daughter. She is the young woman here on the bed. A... a good girl, a virgin and pure of heart. He desired her soul, he said, so I fled location_0 with her. But he caught up to us nevertheless. And somehow he has taken her soul despite my efforts! She... she lies near death, and there is nothing the local priestess can do to help her. I know character_0 is in the cavern that serves as a graveyard in this place. I told the monks about him... but they sealed off the cavern rather than somehow getting my daughter's soul back as I had hoped.
character_1 is the world to me! And I do not know how much longer character_0 will remain trapped in that cavern... he could already be loose! He will kill me and keep character_1's soul, I am sure of it!
Getting inside the cavern is not a problem. I... paid the guard there what little money I have left. I had thought to... try and get character_1's soul myself. But the guard will let in whomever I ask him to.
I have no coin left to offer you. I have bankrupted myself in trying to flee the lich's reach. But... character_0 himself is a powerful wizard. Surely he has items that would interest you, that you could take from him!

One particular man here in location_2 has murdered two of our number in cold blood. He is currently in hiding, and we need you to track the fellow down. We have been unable to do so, much to our frustration. group_0 cannot be assaulted without repercussions or it will lead to... serious problems.
He is character_0, last son of a wealthy family and a true brute. Ask around and you may discover if he is hiding within the city or someplace else. He has a home here in the Docks District, or he may have fled to the location_1. His friends and servants will not speak to us, but they may to you.
We do not ask that you commit any murder. We wish character_0 be delivered to us, that is all. He will likely resist, so if you must kill him, so be it. But if you do kill him, I simply must have his body. character_0 must be delivered to us whether he is dead or alive. You understand, yes?

Greetings, Your Grace. It is I, the majordomo of your castle. We have a small problem here at the keep, one that I doubt that you would be aware of at all.
I am unsure if you have met character_0... She has been a maid here most of her life. She was an orphan, and the group_0 took her in as a servant when she was young. As the ruler of the keep, you are technically her guardian. Ordinarily, that would not be a problem, but there are two men who desire her hand in marriage. It is... up to you, my liege, to give her away and decide which of the men has your blessing for the marriage.
I shall bring them in to see you, my liege. If you do not resolve this issue, then... no one shall be permitted to marry character_0. And I am sure that is not what she wants.

Welcome. I, quest_giver, have been awaiting you. You should know the particulars of your service here and what being a member of the group_0 really means.
You are aware of the conflict with the group_1? There have been invasions into Amnian lands. We have been monitoring outposts, and all is not well. One outpost reported an imminent attack because an enemy unit needed their supplies. A runner barely made it with the information, and we fear the worst.
You must leave immediately for the furthest lengths of the task_location_0. You must join the combat and rescue our knights, for they are surely outnumbered.
Go, and rescue whom you can. You have little time.

I would ask a dangerous thing of you. You're free to refuse, but the greater glory of character_0_0 is at stake.
The character_0_1 takes great pride in the artifacts of his rule. We have many items on display at the temple of character_0_0, from new artworks to the aged relics of bygone days. Today we are one less. We are the victims of thievery, and our followers have been shaken by this vulnerability. Quick steps must be taken to rectify this.
We know the culprits; they have not concealed their crime. group_0, slinking from their temple to degrade our worship, hired common thieves for the deed! They fear no retribution. The character_0_1 cannot suffer his relics in the hands of such evil.
Find these thieves before the group_0 receive the items.

Why are you talking to me? Can't you just steer clear of me?
If you really want to do something interesting, though, I've got something fun for you. Go to the task_location_0. You know, the lethal hellish dimension? You can get there with a portal made out of obsidian. Take a look at the various ruined portals dotting the landscape. Try to sleep in a bed there, and report back to me. I'm very interested in hearing the results of this little experiment.
If the things I've heard about the task_location_0 are true that should teach you a lesson... and I'll even give you a shiny diamond.

Good day to you, traveler! I just love the colorful sheep you brought me: they are so pretty.
There's an interesting thing I heard from a fellow shepherd: if you name a sheep "jeb_", something bizarre is supposed to happen. I'm happy at the moment, but knowing what happens to any sheep named "jeb_" would make me even happier. I something good happens, I shall name all of them so. If something bad happens, I will warn all shepherds about this particular name.
You have to find a name tag. Those are scattered in dangerous places; monster-filled dungeons, abandoned mineshafts, and even the ominous woodland mansions. Feel free to name one of my sheep "jeb_", and please make note of what happens. Do this, and I promise to give you a mountain of wool in all possible colors.

Lava can be found in pools deep under the ground. I'll give you a bucket for scooping out the lava. Blaze rods a trickier to obtain; you have to brave the hellscape that is the task_location_0. Coal, on the contrary, is quite easy to get. Just look out for ore veins seated in stone.

Actually, there is a teeny tiny issue related to the books: a band of group_0 stole a shipment of books and hauled them to their outpost. Would you kindly find and recover the shipment for me? You'll receive number_0 blocks of emerald for your services.

item_0
by quest_giver

Long have I sought to purge the evils haunting character_0. Even when his necromantic studies resulted in our mutual expulsion from the Guild of Mages, I persisted in guiding him towards good with a gentle hand. Alas, in our exile, my old friend has mired himself in the foul practice, and in shocking discovery I learned he had become a miserly disciple of the Worm King, a cunning wraith. A Lich.
Frail memory strengthened by dogmatic resolve, the Archmages turned me away when I came to them with my discovery. My pleas for a detachment of battlemages ignored, only my long-past expulsion remembered. And thus, the grave duty falls only to me. I must bear the burden of purging the Lich that was once a friend.
I wander now into the foreboding maw of these catacombs known as the task_location_0, far from the climes of common elves and men. With pure spirit and rites of cleansing, I hope to strike down the fearsome Lich and set free the soul of character_0, but I leave this testament behind, lest I may never return from these depths; as a warning to those who may follow my path.
Faithful, even in Exile,

character_0 found the Relics and the wraith of character_1 within character_1's tomb: character_0 shouted for quest_giver to take the item_0

Sir knight! I have terrible news. character_0... I think he's dead.
character_0 was a holy knight, like you, questing for the Relics at the Prophet's call. I, quest_giver, was his squire. I believed he was chosen by the gods to reclaim the Relics. At first things were going well. He prayed at all the shrines, and received a vision. A disturbing vision. "The shade of character_1 spoke to me," was all he said. "We must put him to rest." He said that character_1's tomb was in task_location_0 -- which is no cave, but some kind of buried keep.
He had learned that character_1 had once been a questing knight, like us. He had found the Greaves and reward_0, but then turned to evil. character_0 hoped to find the Relics within character_1's tomb. And he did. But we also found a terrible guardian -- the wraith of character_1.
I brought you... character_0 shouted for me to take them... the item_0. The holy Relic. They're yours. The wraith used the reward_0 against character_0. I don't know how that evil thing could use the holy weapon, but it did.
You must avenge character_0 by killing the foul wraith and get yourself the reward_0!

Excuse me. I'm innkeeper quest_giver. We have a small problem that we hope you can help us with.
You may be wondering why you can't see me. We are all wondering the same thing. Everyone in location_0 suddenly became invisible several weeks ago. It was sort of fun at first, but the novelty has definitely worn off now. You can imagine how difficult it is to run an inn while invisible. Once you get a reputation as a haunted inn, you can just forget about it. So we've all been keeping quiet, hoping the spell will wear off. But we're running out of patience. We're sure it was character_0's doing, but we can't find him. If you can help us, we will be extremely grateful.
character_0's a wizard who took up residence in the task_location_0 a couple of years ago. He's caused us no end of trouble with his magical experiments, but nothing as bad as this. We've tried to find him, but had no luck. If he's still living in the fort, he's hiding from us, and no wonder. If you could find him and get him to remove this cursed invisibility, we will all be in your debt. The ruined fort is just to the southeast of here. Follow the path down the hill. But watch out for the invisible monsters that infest the task_location_0!
If you make us visible again, you'd be welcome at the location_0 Inn anytime. Free of charge.

I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with character_0. I never would have guessed he was still alive. We have much to discuss, but if you have time, I'd beg you stay a moment longer and hear about our home, location_0.
location_0 was our family's home for generations. Our parents fled it when ogres attacked; they became separated. My father carried me to safety. He later returned and believed character_0 and my mother had perished. Since ogres are cannibals, he didn't expect to find their bodies. Thankfully, however, it seems that my mother managed to carry character_0 to safety. While my mother didn't survive, character_0 did, and for that I'm grateful.
But we both want more - we want our home back. We're not fighters; you appear to have more skill than either of us. Would you go to location_0, and see if it's still inhabited by ogres?
Now, we're not quite sure where the estate is located. We'll offer up what we know, however. We believe it's somewhere south of location_1, but southwest of location_2. It may be difficult to find. Since no one's lived there for many years, it may be quite overgrown by now.

I begged him to stop, as I knew that his capers would one day lead to violence. He just threatened to... hurt me if I got in his way. I think the gold changed him. I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago. The few times I tried to say something, he'd strike me or push me away. I began to become frightened of him.
Our last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the location_1. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, character_0 killed a guard. I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me. I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the location_0 City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite. I was off gathering food, but character_0 was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it! What I need you to do is go to the task_location_0 and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it.

I'd like you to speak with character_0 at the task_location_0. She is our specialist on magicka arcana, and has been helping gather information.
I believe we have been asking her the wrong questions, taxing her too much with vague attempts to make sense of all that we know. Speak with her specifically about these Black Soul Gems. If she knows anything about their powers or creation.
Her expertise in arcane knowledge and lore could be invaluable to us, if we can make proper use of it. She can likely be found in the task_location_0 now, poring through materials on Necromancy. She stops only to sleep, at the character_1's request.

character_0 is known far and wide as one of the best painters in all location_0. His specialty is setting the Great Forest to canvas. The paintings look so amazingly real that some say they can see the trees sway in the breeze. That's a silly notion of course, but it just goes to show the attention to detail character_0 uses when he paints.
character_0 likes to work in his studio with the door locked, so no one can disturb him. He usually comes out to eat dinner and sleep, but two days ago, he didn't come out at all. At first, I wasn't worried. He does that occasionally. But when he didn't come out for a full day, I unlocked the studio with the key he said to use only in emergencies. It turned out he wasn't inside! I'm sure he never left that room. So I have no idea where he's gone.
Please. Help me find character_0. I love him dearly, and I am so worried. Here's the key to character_0's studio. You may come and go as you please. If you need me, I'll be around the house.

This is the big one. This is the heist that will be written about and talked about for decades to come. We are going to steal one of the item_0 from the task_location_1. Are you ready for this challenge?
There is no buyer. This is for glory, not for money. Our names will become legend. I also have a personal need for this particular scroll. As for your compensation, I ask you to trust me. If my plan works, you will get a reward worth far more than mere money.
I have worked for eleven years planning this heist. item_1 provided the last bit of information I needed. The item_0 are kept in the task_location_1 behind a door that cannot be breached. item_1 has revealed a path around this door. You will have to travel the location_0. Once used as an escape route for Imperial Emperors, it has been forgotten for centuries.
The location_0 can be found in the task_location_0. Here is the key for the gate to that section of the sewers. My scrying with item_1 has provided clues, but not the details. I know the tools you will need there, but not the obstacles themselves. The item_2 will allow you to leap to an unreachable place. They will also protect you from a long fall. The item_3 is the only way to unlock the final door. Take them both.
Once you are inside the task_location_1 itself, you need to find the reading room. The blind priests will deliver a scroll to you there. I arranged for the notable character_0 to want to read a particular item_0. Don't ask how. However, she will be... unavoidably detained. You will take her place. Do not speak to the priests. They are blindfolded and will not realize it isn't her unless you speak. As the guildmaster, I am waiving bloodprice for anyone you kill during this heist. However, I can't stop the Watch from putting a price on your head.
I have written it all down for you in this book. I've chosen you because you are the best. Good luck.

item_0
by quest_giver

character_1 is dead, just like all the others. You continue to impress me, character_0, and I am only too eager to indulge your homicidal instincts.
Your next target is a savage Nord barbarian, living alone and exposed at a small campsite on the summit of location_2. This barbarian, character_2 by name, savagely butchered the chieftain of a mead hall on the island of location_1. The chieftain's sister has forgone the Nord custom of extracting the monetary retribution of wergild, and instead wants character_2 to pay with his life. You, dear character_0, will help put her family at peace.
You are to go to location_2, locate character_2, and send his soul to the great beyond.
When character_2 has been executed, journey to the ancient ruin of location_0. In the flooded section of that ruin you will find a chest, submerged in the water. As you may have guessed, the chest contains your reward for killing character_2, number_0 gold, and your next contract.

I have another job for you. This is not quite in your usual line of work, but I hope you can help me just the same.
A rival collector has an item, the Crown of location_0, which I very much want to add to my collection. But she stubbornly refuses to consider any of my offers. She and I have had our differences over the years, I admit. Now she is taking this opportunity to get her revenge. I believe that you may be able to persuade her to part with the item, where I cannot due to her prejudice against me. Her name is character_0. She lives here in the location_1, in the Elven Gardens district.
I hope you will succeed where I have so far failed. Afterwards, in order to bring my research on the last king of the group_0 to its final stage, I need to go to the Throne Room of location_0. While I am not without means of defending myself, I believe you would be an invaluable companion on such an expedition. Your reward will be whatever plunder you wish to carry off from location_0. Since the Throne Room has been sealed since the time of the group_0, it should provide rich pickings.

Greetings. I'm quest_giver. I'm quite fond of collecting all manners of wines from all over location_0. But one vintage continues to elude me: item_0. How I'd love to add it to my collection.
Apparently the wine is so rare because it was only made in one tiny batch. It's the product of an alchemist who was also a vintner. Besides tasting incredible, the magic within the wine allows the imbiber to be gifted with Night Eye! The vintner made it special for the Legion soldiers posted at the forts when they were active long ago. It was perfect for keeping lookouts warm on cold nights and helping them see better in the dark.
If you can retrieve number_0 bottles of item_0, I'll gladly pay you well: number_1 gold. All I know about them is that they're found in the many fort ruins scattered all over location_1.

I'm not certain what happened to the knight, or why the tears were frozen, but I do know someone you could ask. Seek out character_0 at the task_location_0 in the location_0. She oversees the Alchemy Headquarters there. If anyone can help you get more information on about these crystals, she can.

You're the one the character_0 sent, aren't you? Then you're safe for now. Speak to no one unless I instruct you to. None of them can be trusted. Do you hear me? None! Surrounded by traitors and spies, I am. Always, always. They watch and wait, eager to slip a knife into my spine when I'm not looking.
Could be all of them. Every last one. None can be trusted. But they'll never take me down. Never! I'll see them all rotting in shallow graves before I let my guard down! You... you will help me. Yes, yes. You will be most useful.
You're going to find out who knows. You're going to learn who keeps secrets, who conspires against me. You will be my Grand Inquisitor.

<|begin_description|>
I'm sorry. We've not met. I'm quest_giver, Count of location_3. I understand you're looking for a cure for vampirism. This is fortunate, as I also seek the cure.
I wish to tell you a story so that you might understand why I would trust you with my secrets. More than number_0 years ago, my wife character_0 and I were both turned into vampires. While I came to embrace the changes in myself, she did not. She hated what she had become, and refused to feed to keep herself healthy. She eventually slipped into a coma from which she has not awoken. My trusted servants have cared for her all this time, but I wish for her to at last find peace. The cure is for her. I have researched what I can, but acquiring the cure is beyond my grasp. I cannot risk drawing too much attention to myself. So I would ask that you took up the search on my behalf. If you are successful, I will reward you in whatever small way I can. Will you aid me?
What little I have discovered points to the witches of group_0. In the past, they have been capable of creating a cure. I have searched for these witches throughout location_2, but no covens still exist within its borders. There may be one left. I have unconfirmed reports of a woman seen near the location_0 river, who fits the description of these witches. Seek her out, and learn whether she can help. She lives somewhere along the river, east of the location_4 and south of location_1. If you are successful in finding a cure, report to my steward. You have my thanks.

Selling all sorts of merchandise, character_0 undercuts prices like you wouldn't believe. He doesn't always sell what we sell, but it is still a problem. People who buy tend to want to spend their money there. That leaves none for us. It's getting so bad, a few of us may have to close up shop. He outright refuses to join the Society or even discuss the matter. We are convinced he is up to no good.
What we need is for you to case his establishment, and figure out where he gets his inventory. Find some proof of his wrongdoing, and let us know. We cannot do it ourselves, as he recognizes all of us. The job pays a fair bounty in gold when he is brought to justice.

by quest_giver

My love,
I write this with trembling hands. The guards are after me, and I have nowhere else to turn. Soon they will be at the doors to task_location_0, and nothing will keep them from taking me away back to that horrible prison. I don't know how they found me; perhaps it was that traitor, character_0. Whoever told them I was hiding in your home must have known both of us very well. I know character_0 has eyes for you, I know he's the one that framed me in the first place and had me sent to that dank hole in the location_0. He has to be the one. Beware of him, my love. He's treacherous and only wants you to get to the treasure. I didn't give it up to the guards, and I won't give it up to character_0. I've hidden the treasure within the walls of task_location_0. Remember the toy we played with as we ran through this place as children?
Remember the riddle we had for it? It was our secret code: "Two bodies have I, though both joined in one. The more I stand still, the quicker I run."
The key to the treasure lies with the answer. Take care of it, my love. It is your ticket far from character_0. Do not fret, I've escaped once, I shall do so again. Soon we will be together, and the sun will shine upon us.

character_0 is a thief, but what irks me the most is that he's a BAD thief. Between my shop and a few others in task_location_0, he's been caught stealing maybe a dozen times last month. Who has time for this sort of thing? I mean, at this rate, I'll grow old and die before he's out of our hair! I'll tell you what I tell anyone else who asks.

Some blasted mage. Had a theory. They've always got theories. He thought there was a Manic and a Demented in each of us. So, what does he do? What else? Casts a spell. You can see how well that went. Two of each of us walking around this place. Nothing we can do about it, either. There's a law about that here. Been to the location_0? Not a nice place. But you might be able to help.

Good work. character_0 and his guardsmen should be able to handle any additional Gates, at least for now. But the location_0 Guard cannot defend the city indefinitely. The group_0 of Oblivion are innumerable; the guardsmen of location_0 are not.
We need to gather what allies we can before location_0 is hopelessly besieged. If the group_1 manages to open a Great Gate here, the city will need a stronger garrison for there to be any hope of defending it.
You should speak to the rulers of the other cities of location_1, as well as the group_2. Ask them to send aid to location_0 before it is too late.

I was a group_0_0 from location_0. As soon as I heard the gates to the location_1 opened, I knew a threat was lurking inside. I made my way here and began exploring this strange place. As I was passing task_location_0, I was waylaid. Some dastardly group_1 stole my most prized possession... my medallion that signified my membership in the Knights. It's a small, round, item_0. On the back is the inscription "To quest_giver, from character_0".
Could you bring back my medallion from the group_1 at task_location_0? I will mark task_location_0 on your map. You could have reward_0 as a reward. Good luck to you, friend!

Allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm quest_giver. I assume you've noticed all of the group_0 relics I'm displaying.
Well, it's safe to say I'm a collector of sorts. I've invested a great deal of time and money acquiring these bits of ancient history. In fact, I'd be so bold as to proclaim my collection the most complete in all location_0; perhaps even beyond. Except for one thing.
A particular relic has eluded me for many years. Possessing this piece of group_0 antiquity would make my collection complete. I'm of course referring to The item_0. The stone is a fine bit of group_0 craftsmanship. Worn like an amulet, this talisman is said to protect the wearer from poisons of any type. The talisman appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such. Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the item_0 was the ruins at Pale Pass.
If you retrieve the item_0 for me, I'll be happy to compensate you by rewarding you with another group_0 artifact. Are you in the game?
Let me tell you how you're going to find the talisman. I've come into the possession of a diary written by an group_0 messenger. I suspect that the text within can lead you to the ruins. Here's a translation of the passages we could still read. It was quite damaged. I've also included a rough map that was drawn in the diary as well. I'm also providing you with a unique key that was supposedly found with the diary. I'm assuming it will prove useful when you arrive at the site.

You must first kill his living body. While beyond the power of most mortals, this is only the lesser of your two tasks. It will allow you to follow character_1 into the spirit realm upon his death.

Far to the west there lives a fierce warlord and his company of loyal mercenaries. Your target is the warlord. Do you accept this contract?
Now listen closely. Nestled in the mountains to the west lies task_location_0. It is the home of the warlord character_0 and his mercenaries. character_0 has recently taken ill. He now lies in eternal slumber, kept alive only by the daily administration of a powerful medicine.
You must infiltrate task_location_0, find character_0's medicine, and replace it with a poisoned bottle I will provide. But you must remain undetected! Whomever arranged this contract wants it to look like character_0 died from his illness, so discretion is essential. Attack no one! Be seen by no one! If you are detected, the poisoning will fail, and character_0 must be killed in some other manner. That will, of course, forfeit your bonus.

Please, I'll give you number_0 gems as a token of my gratitude. They're all I have left of value, but you must have them if you do the deed.

We need a item_0. You're not going to like it. character_0 doesn't like it. The character_1 of task_location_0 certainly isn't going to like it. item_0 are the anchors of Great Gates. The kind of gate the group_0 opened at location_0. The kind of Gate the group_0 wants to open here to destroy task_location_0.
The risk is great, I know. I was at location_0. I saw the terrible power of the Daedric siege engine. But we have no choice. The only way to recover the item_1 is to allow the group_0 to proceed with their plan to attack task_location_0.
Please, my friend. I explain myself to you so you understand me. And so you can explain to the character_1. I'm afraid she may take a bit more convincing than you.
Have the character_1 of task_location_0 meet me in the location_1 for a council of war. That seems a fitting place to make such desperate plans.

Ah! Our newest member. I'm glad you stopped by. I have a... situation that you might be able to help with.
The character_0 has asked me to take care of a problem, and I'm putting you on it. character_1 actually collected taxes from everyone living here on the Waterfront! Your job is to recover those taxes.
The people of the waterfront are very poor. Traditionally the city has not collected taxes from them, even though by law they could. The money the city would collect would barely cover the cost of collecting. The character_0 has always guaranteed protection to the poor of the waterfront. He doesn't want to let this injustice stand. It's a matter of principle.
Find out where character_1 is keeping the taxes and bring them to me. I'll also need the tax records of what each citizen paid so we can return it.

<|end_tools|>
<|begin_description|>
Greetings. It is high time that we met face to face, don't you think? character_1 has told me good things about you. You have advanced quickly, and show great promise. I now intend to put your talents to a more direct test.
I have a difficult task that you can, perhaps, assist with. Let me explain what is at stake. The group_1 has been aware of the increased Necromancer activity in location_3 for some time. It had been our position to sit back and watch what unfolded, but that time has clearly passed. We cannot tolerate these attacks on the guild. Most of our information on Necromancers has come from an informant inside the cult itself, a guild member who offered to infiltrate their ranks.
Though the information he has provided is limited, it has given us a sense of their scope and power. The Council was initially reluctant to believe the information was reliable, but with recent events, they have little choice but to trust it. I fear that our informant is in danger, and that is why I have called you here.
The informant is a mage called character_0. He is not a Council member, but has long served the guild here at the Arcane University. Aware in the growing interest in the guild after the band of Necromancy was put into place, he offered to help the Council track the cult's actions. With my blessing, he infiltrated the group, and has fed us information for quite some time, until recently. I have not heard from him, and I fear for his safety.
The lack of reports from character_0 has disturbed the Council, and they are now concerned about the legitimacy of his information. A group of Battlemages were dispatched to character_0's last know location, with the intent on bringing him in for questioning. I argued against it, but eventually agreed to maintain order in the Council. I regret that decision, and that is why I wish to send you there. I fear the Battlemages may mistreat character_0, if they do not mistake him for one of the many Necromancers no doubt present in the ruins.
I wish for you to find character_0, and ensure his safe return to the Arcane University. I do not want anything to go wrong. Please, hurry. The Battlemages will arrive there soon, if they have not already, and time is of the essence. If for any reason they are unsuccessful, character_0' life will be forfeit. You must make sure he is safe. Go now, and bring word to me as soon as he has been escorted to safety. character_0 last reported being sent to the ruins of task_location_0, south of the location_0. That is where the Battlemages went. South of the location_1, nearly halfway to the border of location_2. I'm afraid I know nothing more about the location, or what you may expect to find once you arrive.

character_0 is gone, but hope is not lost. We have a rare opportunity here, but I hesitate to do what must be done. If the Throne of Madness remains empty when character_1 storms the palace, he will prevail. But there is a chance that the throne may not be empty. The only way to protect the Realm from character_1 is to place you in the Throne of Madness.
Unfortunately, when character_0 faded, the power of the reward_0 faded with him. It must now be remade. The Staff is the symbol of power in this Realm. He who rightfully holds the Staff may hold the throne of the Shivering Isles. However, the secrets of its construction are lost.
That which is lost can be found again. There is one being in the Shivering Isles who may be able to assist you in the construction of a new Staff. The ruins of task_location_0 once served as a great library. There, you will find a door. Behind that door, you will find the answer you seek.
Take this crystal. It contains the power to open the sealed door. Inside, you will find the final remnants of the library. Be mindful of what you find there. The library is a thing of Order, and it will still serve that end.

Do you recall the name character_0? The Imperial Legion pest? It's time he joined Death in the Void. Think you're up to the task?
character_0 has spent his entire career investigating the group_0, interrupting our contracts, killing our family members! We tried to eliminate character_0, of course, but failed on three separate occasions. He's a powerful man, and was surrounded by powerful associates. Now the Legion's pig's years of service have come to an end. He has retired. character_0 must not be allowed such a victory! His destiny is... darker. character_0 now resides in task_location_0, in the City Watch barracks, an honored guest of the soldiers there. He is, in fact, more vulnerable than ever.
The group_1 has sanctioned the item_0. It is a magic arrow specifically enchanted to kill its target. In this case, character_0. As long as the arrow hits character_0, he will die. But it cannot pierce armor! Shoot while character_0 is armored, and the Rose will be wasted. Travel to task_location_0. Track character_0. Learn his schedule. Observe when he removes that blasted Legion armor! And then, let fly the item_0! Kill character_0 in any way, Rose or not, and the contract is complete. But to receive a bonus, you must go beyond murder. You must send a message! Once character_0 is dead, take the very finger from his corpse, the one that bears an Imperial Legion signet ring! Deposit this finger in the desk of character_0's successor, in his office in the Prison Barracks, in the location_0! Do this, and the bonus is yours.

Eliminate character_0 in any manner you see fit. As a pirate, character_0 has certainly spilled his share of blood. Someone wants revenge, and they've hired us to extract it.
The pirates have been moving a lot of cargo onboard lately. You may be able to smuggle yourself onboard in one of the packing crates. Oh, and one more thing. Get into the habit of asking your fellow assassins about any current contract. Their insight may prove invaluable.

So you want to learn more about the ghostly character_0?
The character_0 looks like he may have been a sailor. No one knows where he came from, or why he looks so sad. I don't like talking about the dead like they're some kind of tourist attraction, but that spirit has been making his ghostly journey for years now. We've learned to just accept that he's there.
Every night, sure as clockwork, he appears at task_location_0 at number_0 on the shore of location_0. He's never harmed anyone, but most people give him a wide berth. You seem curious enough, so I'll be glad to pinpoint where he appears on your map.

<|end_tools|>
<|begin_description|>
quest_giver. I may have a bit of a proposition for you involving the group_0 family you so recently assisted.
It was kind of you to escort the group_0 back to location_0. However, their father, the original owner of location_0 left them an even greater legacy.
My tale actually begins with the father, character_0. He was once in my employ, or should I say the employ of my organization. He was very good at obtaining things from people who did not want to part with. A professional thief, to put it bluntly. He was assigned to obtain a very valuable item for me. He succeeded, but decided to keep this item for himself. An unfortunate decision.
character_0 fled from location_1 with his family, and was never heard from again. Only his small son character_1 was found, wandering alone in the wilderness. Naturally, my associates and I believed he had perished. The wilderness is, after all, a dangerous place. No place to take your family. Then, these many years later, voila! The brother reappears. It seems the rest of the family did not die in the wilderness after all.
What is the point of my tale? character_0 builds location_0 way out in the middle of nowhere. He was a thief, not a farmer. The only reason to establish such a place would be to stay out of the location_1 Guard's sight. I believe that the item character_0 stole, which rightly belongs to me, was hidden at location_0. Unfortunately, the notorious task_location_0 Ogres ransacked the place and probably took all of the loot back with them.
If you were to obtain this item, somehow, and bring it to me, I would pay you very well for it.

Good. You're here. We've got duties to attend to.
I've been looking into the group_1. Heard some disturbing things. We know they're a danger to us. And we know they're good at what they do.
I've heard stories, but nothing I can prove is true. Maybe they've got a mage working with them. Maybe they're just well trained. All I know for sure is that they'll accept any contract, and they'll do anything to complete it. And they don't care who gets in the way.
We were contracted by a wizard, character_1, to recover an artifact from character_0, a ruthless bandit leader. I went in there with twenty men. I left with five. character_2 wasn't one of them. He died covering our retreat. I snooped around. Apparently, the group_1 completed that contract for us. I went in there with twenty good men. I can't believe that bunch finished the job. There's more. character_1 -- he's dead, the artifact gone. Sounds like a set-up. Maybe they made a deal with character_0. I don't know. But I'll find out.
Now we find out what really happened. And we let it be known. I want to show the people who the group_1 really are. I can't order you do this with me. It's dangerous, and character_3 isn't going to know about it. It's your choice.
If you accept this mission, we leave as soon as you're ready. I want to investigate character_0's stronghold at task_location_0. Meet me at the location_0 guild hall. We'll go from there.

You have my, quest_giver', tribute, sir knight. In three hundred years, none have passed the gauntlet. In three hundred years, we have never known hope. But for the first time, it seems that someone may succeed where we have failed. I see in you the chance to redeem our souls and restore the order. And now, I must ask you to press forward where I could not. I must ask you to face the challenge of character_0.
I was arrogant and foolhardy. I sought personal glory. I placed my own will and my own lust for fame over the will of the group_0. In facing the challenge of character_0, I failed. I tried dozens -- no, hundreds of times to reach the Mace. I fell each time. And each time I awoke in the chapel, I leaped again. I tried to enlist the help of the other knights, but none would come to my aid. The inscription says to "walk in the faith" but even now, I do not know what this means.
Below the Chapel of character_0 in location_0 there is a shrine to the great craftsman, character_1. Those seeking the Mace must pray before the shrine. When you bow, you will receive a vision -- or perhaps not. It is unclear. The priests saw that my body never moved, but it felt so real. You will see the reward_0, separated from you by a great chasm. The chasm represents your doubt. Your faith must be your guide across it.
This is what I know. As I said, my faith was weak. I did not understand the test and I fell from the platform each time I tried to cross. I have told you all that I know. All that is left is for you to prove yourself more worthy than I. If you seek the Mace, travel to location_0's chapel, kneel at the shrine in the undercroft, and let your faith in the group_0 be the salvation of us all.

by quest_giver

Are you ready to get your hands dirty, Silencer?
Your next target is a Khajiit nobleman by the name of character_0, who can be found at his home in the city of location_0. character_0 was recently offered the hand of a prominent location_1 noble's daughter, but turned down the offer when he learned of the girl's rather negligible dowry. The girl's family is outraged, of course, and has hired the group_0 to make character_0 pay for his insolence.
Go to character_0's house in location_0 and end his miserable life. But be warned! The Khajiit is rich and bored, and spends most of his time honing his skills in unarmed combat. Any opponent who can kill with merely his hands is not to be trifled with, so tread carefully. Even worse, character_0 is aware someone may be trying to kill him, and has bribed the guards not to interfere if a fight should spill out into the city streets.
When the target has been eliminated, you will find your next dead drop in a rotten box under the Old Bridge, just south of the Imperial City. The box will contain your reward for killing character_0, as well as information regarding your next contract.

I am quest_giver, and you have violated the inner sanctum of task_location_0 Keep.
However, my people and I are in need. Maybe you can help us. Centuries ago, task_location_0 was overrun by group_0. We were soft and failed to defend ourselves. I was the weakest of all. Now, the shades of my people are cursed by character_0 to repeat the final moments of their failures, over and over again. You must help us break the cycle of torment.
Help my people overcome their weakness and defend task_location_0 from the group_0. Walk among them. There were four who failed to protect the gate lever. Find out what they did wrong and help them correct it. You can put away your sword in these halls. Unlike the defending spirits, within these walls, none will war with you. Not even the group_0.
My people long to be laid to rest. Please help them.

The gods grant insight to those they deem worthy. Why and how they act is not predictable. What I can tell you is that traditionally, knights who wished to quest for the Relics would walk the Pilgrim's Way.

I, quest_giver, know where you may find the reward_0, for I was the one who lost them when I was still alive. Though many know where they are, they are still lost. I believe there is something you must do in order to retrieve them.
When the Order fractured, I followed character_0 into war, taking the Gauntlets with me. When it was over, I returned to this land. I attempted to return to the service of the group_0, but the war had changed me. I no longer had sympathy for the weak, or pity for the suffering. In the brief time I was there, I did more to hurt the Chapel of character_1 than help it. It was there that I was cursed.
A beggar who came to the Chapel each day for help tried my patience one too many times. I lost my temper, and struck him. My blow landed harder than I had intended, and he fell to the floor, dead. Killed in the very Chapel of the God of Mercy. I left the Chapel at once, of course, but the damage was done. I was weak, constantly weary, and lacked the energy to do almost anything.
As proof of the deed, when I struck the poor man the Gauntlets slipped right off my hands and fell to the floor. Heavy as stone, they would not move. None could lift them. I suspect they lie there still, in task_location_0's Chapel. You must prove to character_1 you are worthy to lift the Gauntlets once more. Seek out the priests of character_1 in task_location_0. Perhaps they can help you.

The Necromancer character_0 is dead, and you are not. That is quite an accomplishment. But your work as a Silencer has just begun.
Your next assignment requires you to eliminate not just one target, but five. An entire family, in fact. The unlucky kin are character_1, character_2_0, character_2_1, character_2_2 and character_2_3. The locations of most of the family members are unknown, so you should begin your search with the family matron, character_1, who resides at the farm called task_location_0.
You must discern the locations of all the group_0 family members and then systematically eliminate them. I suggest you first speak with the mother and find out if she has any valuable information on the whereabouts of her children, before ending her life.
When every member of the group_0 family lies dead, journey to the city of location_0. In the castle courtyard you will find a well containing your reward for the group_0 contract, as well any further assignment I might have.

item_0
by quest_giver

If you're reading this note, character_1 is dead. You've done the world a great service, Silencer. It's time to continue the good work.
Your next target is a traveling Dark Elf merchant by the name of character_0, who is currently renting a house in the city of location_4. character_0 is a well-respected tradesman back in his native location_1, but his business often takes him very far from home. Therein lies the problem. character_0's wife has become disillusioned with her husband's repeated, extended absences and wishes to dissolve their marriage, and has sought the group_0's assistance. Lucky for us location_0 is a bit beyond the reach of location_1's group_1.
character_0 is currently traveling around location_0, and is never in one place for more than a couple of days. In this dead drop you will also find a schedule detailing the Dark Elf's whereabouts; use it to locate him and plan your elimination. Be aware, however, that because he is forced to travel alone to the farthest reaches of the Empire, character_0 has learned to defend himself. He is a master of the Destruction school of Magicka, and is no stranger to killing.
When character_0 lies rotting, journey to the Market District of the location_3. There you will find a shop called location_2. Your dead drop is located behind that building, in a hollowed-out tree stump. As usual, you will find your reward for the previous contract, as well as information on your next.
Ah yes, I must mention one last detail. Apparently character_0 suffers from a rare Dark Elf condition, a serious allergy to honey. If you could somehow get character_0 to drink the honey-based mead, perhaps by replacing his food, he would suffer from complete paralyzation. This would certainly make the Dark Elf a bit easier to deal with.

Hear me, and hear me well. character_0 will have what he seeks, but it will be his undoing at your hands.
With this gem in your possession, you will be impervious to his attempt to enthrall you. When he fails, that is when you shall strike. When we are done speaking, you will take this gem, you will then seek out character_0, and destroy him. Get to him anyway you can. It is your only hope for defeating him. I have full confidence in you, and so I leave the guild in your care.
When I am gone, you will be recognized as Arch-Mage and leader of the Guild. Lead your fellow mages, and lead them well. The future rests on your shoulders.
Farewell, my friend.

<|end_tools|>
<|begin_description|>
I've deciphered part of the ritual needed to open a portal to location_0.
The item_1 mentions four items needed for the ritual, but so far I have only deciphered one of them: the 'blood of a group_0 Lord'. In fact, item_2 artifacts are known to be formed from the essence of a item_2 Lord, from whence they derive their great power. Not an easy thing to come by, obviously, but we will need a item_2 artifact.
The only way to obtain a item_2 artifact is through the cults devoted to each of the item_2 Lords. The book item_0 is the best introduction to item_2 cults. The library here has a copy if you need it.
Bring the artifact to me when you have acquired one. Remember, the item_1 ritual will consume the physical form of the artifact in order to release its item_2 power.

character_1's disappeared. I mean he's really disappeared. No one here has seen him in days. character_2 thinks maybe a spell backfired. If someone from the group_1 were to stop by, and find him gone, it'd look bad for me. I can't have that. Talk to the mages here, and see what you can find out.

Do you like parties? Because you've been invited to one. Of course you'll be killing all the other guests. Each guest, at some point in the past, wronged their mysterious host. Now he's hired us to exact his revenge. Are you ready to attend?
You need to go to the city of location_0, to the large house known as task_location_0. There you will meet up with five very unlucky guests. In order to receive your bonus, you must kill each guest secretly, one by one. If anyone sees you committing murder, the bonus is forfeit. The guests believe there is a chest of gold hidden in the house, and have agreed to be locked inside until one of them finds it. In fact, the guests believe the key to the manor is inside the chest, and only by satisfying their greed will they be allowed to leave. Poor fools. There is, of course, no chest of gold. The guests will find no key. After you arrive, the doors will be locked behind you, as everyone expects. When all the guests lie dead, you will be free to leave.
Now go, see the doorman at task_location_0. He will explain the rest. Have fun.

I'm a fisherman. Or at least, I was. Until one of those enemy_0 damn near took my leg off. I was collecting their scales, see. I had a contract with this young alchemist. You wouldn't believe what he was paying for those scales! Then last month, one of the bastards got ahold of my leg. Took me right out of the business. But this alchemist, he needs the scales right away. The alchemist was paying so much for the scales that I'm close to having enough saved so that I can retire. But now, I can't get out there to task_location_0 -- not with this leg. I only needed number_0 more scales! Can you believe it? I was so close!

I'm quest_giver, the group_0 of Madness. I've been waiting for you, or someone like you, or someone other than you, for some time.
Now? You run an errand for me. An important one. Of course, anything I tell you to do is important. My Realm, my rules. You're going to task_location_0, one of my favorite spots in the location_0. It's a little place I use to take care of unwanted visitors. And some are more unwanted than others.
There are those that have other ways into my Realm, and they're on the move. We don't want them here. Trust me. So, you're going to get task_location_0 up and running. Here's a little book to tell you how, and the item_0. You'll need that, too. Of course, you can always get more details from character_0. He's a detail-oriented type of person. A big help. And a snappy dresser.
Now, get going. Before I change my mind. Or my mind changes me.

Hail knight! I am quest_giver, whose Relics you seek with a worthy heart!
Your prayers have woken me from my endless dream. Or perhaps you have entered my dream, and I still sleep. I think others have sometimes spoken to me, others like you, but my memory is doubtful. Perhaps the others came after you. Your need must be great for the gods to allow us to speak. Has character_0 found a way back? The foulest of a foul race. A thousand curses upon his unholy name!
I thought I'd won. But I should have known. The Slavemasters are a cunning breed. character_0 found a way to cheat death, as I could not. If you would seek for my Relics, I know little that can help you. All that has passed since my death is like mist that my mind cannot take hold of. My friends built a shrine upon the site of my death, task_location_0, where the group_0 Elves tormented me in a final act of revenge. I can show you where it once stood. Perhaps it is there still.
Fare thee well, sir knight. May the gods grant you to destroy character_0 utterly, as I failed to do.

About two days ago, character_1's son, character_0, entered the Oblivion Gate with six other men. We haven't heard from them since then. The character_1 fears the worst, and has posted guards here so we can watch and see if anyone comes back out. So far, nothing.
At this point, character_1 is offering a reward for the recovery of his son from inside the gate... or confirmed news of his demise. If you find him or the rest of the group_0, get them out of there. I'm sure that the character_1 would also be pleased if the gate was closed.
The group_0 are a bunch of rabble who fancy themselves true knights. character_0 formed the group around two years ago. They make grand boasts, and talk a good talk, but that's all they are. The real work goes to us, the City Guard. I hate to speak ill of them, as something horrible may have happened, but their own bravado got them into this mess.

by quest_giver

My compliments on another job well done! character_1 was more swine than man, and deserved to die quivering like an animal! You must not stop! You must kill again!
Your next target is a Wood Elf named character_0, who resides in the city of task_location_0. task_location_0 is also home to an ancient statue known as the item_1. It is seen as a symbol of good luck and prosperity, and the fools of task_location_0 often speak to the statue and wish for good tidings. Every night, poor lovestruck character_0 visits the statue and pleads desperately for the heart of a young maiden. This maiden is married, and her husband has learned of character_0's affection for his bride. He fears the competition, it would seem, and has commissioned the group_0 to help in the matter.
You must go to task_location_0, locate character_0, and kill him. The Wood Elf owns a house in the city, but he spends his days securely locked inside. I recommend you lie in wait at the item_1 statue, and then eliminate character_0 when he arrives for his nightly visit. He's generally there between the hours of 6:00 PM and 1:00 AM.
By all accounts, character_0 is a deadly archer and a fearless opponent. I also have reason to believe he is expecting trouble, so if character_0 senses danger, he may attack you on sight. Be vigilant, and bring the Wood Elf down! You must not fail!
When character_0's body lies broken at the foot of his dear statue, you must journey to the city of location_0. Your dead drop is in a barrel located behind the statue in the pond. As is standard, your reward and next contract will be waiting.

I, quest_giver, have a special contract that needs fulfillment. In truth. I don't wish to offer it to any other guild member. I've come to rely on your abilities.
We're usually called upon to take a life, but not this time. This contract requires us to stage the assassination of a marked man.
You must go to the city of task_location_0 and break into the house of character_0. Inside you will find character_0 waiting for you. Do not kill him! You see, character_0 is a marked man. He owes a considerable sum to the wrong kind of people. So, they have sent an enforcer to kill him. This is an unusual contract, character_0 had to make a special arrangement with us before it was approved. I trust in your professionalism.
Here, take this knife. The blade has been coated with a rare poison called item_0. One drop in a normal human bloodstream will mimic the effects of death immediately. I will provide you with a vial of antidote, which will be used to revive character_0 after you successfully stage his death. You should also know that there's only enough item_0 on the blade for this one contract. After character_0 is sliced, the knife will be useless.
As payment, I'll be pleased to award you this amulet, reward_0.

Ever broken out of jail? How do you feel about breaking into one? The location_0, to be exact. We need a prisoner... silenced. Can you do it?
Your target is a Dark Elf named character_0. He thinks he's safe in prison. He is tragically mistaken. A prisoner recently escaped from the prison, using a set of secret tunnels connecting to the location_1's sewer system. It's a perfect way inside. Just outside of the location_0 is a grating that leads to the sewers. It has recently been tightly locked, but I will provide a key. It should be easy enough to locate character_0 in his small cell. Besides, I think you know the way, hmmm. He he he he he.
character_0 has been imprisoned for many years. His tongue is sharp, but his body is limp and frail. He will prove an easy, pleasurable kill. You will receive a bonus if you fulfill the contract without killing any of the prison guards. Now go, and may the Night Mother go with you.

<|begin_description|>
Hail, friend. I don't believe I've ever seen you down here in the Bloodworks before. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is quest_giver_0.
I grew up here in the Imperial City, but I was born elsewhere. My mother was a servant in the employ of character_0, and resided at his fortress. character_1 was a shrew of a woman. The Lord and my mother grew close, and ultimately fell in love. I was the result of their union. When the Lady learned of my birth she was furious, and threatened to kill both my mother and me. So we fled, leaving my claim to nobility behind.
My mother died recently. Before she passed, she gave me this key, and told me it would "unlock the truth," at the place of my birth, task_location_0. task_location_0 is a ruined fort far to the west of here. I'd go myself, but my training regiment doesn't allow for the luxury of such an excursion.
My friend, you must travel to task_location_0 and use the key to unlock whatever it is that holds the proof of my birthright! Find this proof and return it to me, and I'll share with you some of my finest combat techniques. Trust me, you can't learn these moves in a book!

item_0
by quest_giver

I guess you found the message I told you about, old friend. We've traveled together for so long, and you're the only one I trust with the ring and my story.
I knew climbing into the window of that wizard's house was a mistake, but the bounty on the ring was just too enticing to pass up. They said it was worth thousands of drakes... enough to keep me comfortable for a while as I lay low. They also said the owner of the ring was out of town at some meeting of wizards or some such.
They were wrong on both counts. You'd think I'd be used to this by now, dealing with the unpredictable in our line of work. But after trying to fence the ring all over the realm, no one would touch it. Worse still, the wizard was pursuing me the entire time. I had to call in many favors to stay one step ahead of him.
I decided to strike north and make for the neighboring land. As I was crossing the location_0, he finally caught up to me. Two fireballs later, I found myself tumbling down a steep snowy slope into a valley. Don't know where I am, but there are ruins of some old fort here. Luckily, that fetcher didn't follow me down; I assume he gave me up for dead.
I think I'm going to stash the ring in this valley, cross the border north, and return later when I feel it's safe. I've used some old chests I found in the ruins to make sure nobody stumbles across the ring by mistake; you know, the old key to a key thing like we used to do. If I don't make it back here, and you're reading this message, then the ring is all yours, my friend. Use it well and remember me.

These stupid group_0 are driving me crazy! I'm at my wit's end! I, quest_giver, beg you to help me!
The beastly little creatures are nasty, smelly, noisy and wrecking my beautiful house! I must be rid of them! I can't let people know I have group_0 in here, or they'll think I've taken to group_1 worship. Try explaining that to the town guard.
I had a feeling buying that item_0 would be trouble. Now I'm paying for it with more than just some gold. A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through location_0 and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the staff you see me carrying. I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured. After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense. However, when I spoke it and held the staff, four group_0 suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there. It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with group_0 following, so I decided to discard the staff. I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This staff is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it.
Oh please, I beg you! Take this staff to task_location_0 and get rid of it and the group_0 forever! I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear!
Do this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable ring. reward_0.

enemy_0 overcame us with tenacity and numbers. Didn't help that we'd grown a little too comfortable up there. Too much mead. Too many stories. Too few battles.
Are you... offering to help? Some new blood should be enough to rouse these layabouts to actually fight again.

I am quest_giver, a priest of character_1. I came into character_1's light after the Great War. So many died by my hands, my magics.
I'm fortunate that character_0 and the people of location_0 have come to accept me as one of their own.
Could you do an old elf a favor? I misplaced my journal in a cave I was exploring. I'll pay for its return.
Blessing of character_1 to you for your help.

Well, I'm hoping to do something similar... if I could connect a living being to the forces of nature... well... that would be formidable. I've done some experiments in this area, but, well, my test subjects are far too fragile. I'm hoping to learn some of the group_1 techniques, their methods.
I need you to examine one of them. Just investigate as much as you can. The group_0 live in the hills on the western edge of location_0. From there, you're on your own. I'm given to understand that they are not difficult to find, if you gather my inference.

Do this task for me and you'll be well on your way to a title in location_0. Report back to me when your task is complete.

Pay a visit to the beast's last known contact. Do what you must to find where it's hiding now.

There have been reports of weird happenings near task_location_0. Travelers disappearing, odd lights. I suspect wild animals or perhaps bandits.
The cave has a bad history. Long ago, character_0 used it for necromantic rituals. That's where it got the name. That was over number_0 years ago. Nothing much down there now - but everyone's always convinced the cave is haunted.
I don't think it's worth our time with the war going on, but if you want to clear out the cave, I'll make sure you're repaid for your work.

Vampires enjoy stalking their prey. Passing among us undetected emboldens them. Makes them feel powerful, untouchable. But we'll put a swift end to that.
Tread lightly. The vampire can cloud the minds of those he preys upon. It won't be easy to convince anyone he's other than he appears. The law is unaware of the danger and will treat you as a criminal if you are caught. You must be clever. Find a way not to be caught or accused of murder.
We must be vigilant and self sufficient if we are to defeat these monsters.

Commanding the group_0 Guard can be a difficult task. Even the most experienced warriors can fall prey to petty distractions.

It's powerful and tremendously addicting... I've seen men fail to finish even a single flask.
If I knew where they were stashing the bottles, I'd put an end to it myself. Could you track down the stash? That would be helpful. I just don't have time to do it myself right now.

Lord character_0. Remember your place. Now, he wants the Chalice, then.
You've heard of the item_0? The Chalice has been in Lord character_0's possession for quite some time now. It is, when used properly, able to increase the potency of our powers.
Lord character_0 has neglected using the Chalice for ages. If he wants it filled now, then grander things are afoot. This is good.
Follow me. I'll take you to the item_0.

If you haven't, I can't say that I am surprised. Until I get my second volume published, no one will ever know of my achievements. In order to write the second volume of my opus, I need the notes from my first volume. Otherwise I need to do all of this from memory.
When I was tossed in here I felt myself falling… and I dropped the pages I had been holding. There were ten of them in all.
Find them for me, please, I beg you!

item_0
by quest_giver

I was skeptical, but it's obvious now. The old hymns had truth to them! The relief wasn't far from the entrance, just as they said. I've no doubt now that it hides the entrance to character_0's tomb.
The two keys must be hidden somewhere nearby - ceremonial replicas of item_1, favored weapons when character_0 went into battle. I don't dare explore further without hiring bodyguards to accompany me, however. To think - The character_0 could be entombed behind just a few feet of stone! The ancestor we scarcely believed was real.
Twice damned for planning this foolish scouting trip. I should have hired those sellswords in the first place. Perhaps there's no need. This place is just a tomb, after all, and there are no obvious signs of habitation. It isn't as though the thousand-year dead will mind if I have a look around.

Last I knew, she was out in the Reach, convinced she was about to find the biggest dwarven ruins yet. You'll also want to find character_1. Big brute of a Nord, hates vampires almost as much as I do. Got it into his head years back that his experience with animals would help. Trolls in particular, from what I hear.
If you can find them, we might have a chance.

You pursue character_0_0, the character_0_1. A fateful errand. No few have chafed to face the Worm since first he set his soul-snare here at task_location_0's threshold. But character_1 restrained our wrathful onslaught - perhaps, deep counseled, your doom he foresaw.

Dear sibling. I've been waiting for you. Your next contract awaits, as I'm sure character_0 indicated.
With the Emperor's arrival in location_0 now a certainty, his security service, the group_0, will need to begin its preparations immediately. Security is being handled by a character_3. character_0 and I have devised a plan to break the man, and in doing so, cripple the Emperor's protection.
You are to slay the commander's son, character_1, and once he is dead, plant false evidence on his body implicating him in a plot to kill the Emperor. He is set to leave the group_0 outpost at location_1, and inspect the security of each city in location_0. Go there now. Observe character_1's departure, and follow him. Waylay him in one of the cities, and send his soul to Sithis. Once he's dead, plant the incriminating letter on his body, and let fate take care of the rest. Oh, and one final thing...
To earn your bonus, do not kill character_1 in location_1, or on the road. Kill him in one of the other major cities he'll be visiting. There, the body will be discovered quickly, as will the letter implicating character_1 in the plot to assassinate the Emperor. Do that, and character_0 has authorized me to grant you a rather unique bonus. It is a special token, to be given to character_2, in location_2. character_2 is an old and dear friend, and a powerful seer. The token entitles you to a reading of your future. It's an opportunity one should not pass up.

Fortunately, the spirits seem to be sticking to the barrow. I think they're guarding it. Certainly isn't helping my business any; who'd want to rent a room anywhere near a haunted barrow?
If you think there's anything you can do, be my guest. About a year or two ago, some fella named character_0 came through; said he was some kind of a treasure hunter. I warned him not to go in there, just like I warned you. The very next night we heard screams from the barrow, and that was it. We never saw him again.

character_0 was the bard who invented the eight course lute that is commonplace today. Until he found a way to string the extra courses, bards only had six course lutes. The lute they stole is character_0's original eight course lute. I doubt they even realize its true value.

Simple right? Almost. The catch is it doesn't count if anyone sees you take it. The message needs to be clear; we work in the shadows.
Steal from anywhere in task_location_0, and you even get to keep everythin' you stole. So, you in?

I want to add some punch to our crossbow capabilities, I've done all I can on my own. I need a little inspiration. I've always been fascinated with group_1 artifacts. I take them apart, poke around in their guts, and try to figure things out - with mixed results.
But as luck would have it, I've tracked down the location of some actual group_1 diagram drawings! So, if you'd be a dear and collect those plans for me at task_location_0?
With the group_1 diagrams and a little tinkering I should be able to improve the capabilities of our crossbows.

I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway. I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons. I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame. That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control. Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever.
You would take the ring back to character_0_0? Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore. Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the character_0_1 should smile on you and appear before you.

Before we get down to business, I've got something I need you to do.
Well, as you know, the Guild's growing and things are looking up around here. The only thing we're lacking is a reliable way to transport our merchandise across the land.
I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there are several caravans that travel across the realm. They're shrewd traders and don't mind getting their hands dirty.
I've bartered with their leader, character_0, on more than one occasion. I want you to bring him something. You see, the caravans are notorious for transporting illegal substances.
Present character_0 with this satchel of item_0, and I bet my last coin he'll make a deal.

You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to character_0, there'll be hell to pay.
character_0's a close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us. Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in location_0.
The city guard in location_0 is seeking character_0 for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine? Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in location_1, so there's still a chance to save him.
The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from location_0 warning location_1's guard to be on the lookout for character_0. The second is to change character_0's name in the prison registry to his new identity.
The job is relatively difficult. If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional from the group_0. You see both of these items are kept inside location_2, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers.
One more thing. If you get caught, I can't afford to be connected to you. Remember that before you do anything stupid.

<|end_tools|>
<|begin_description|>
Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?
The group_0 are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred. One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of group_1 Coven. If the group_0 would hunt in the name of their lord, character_0, we would be granted great power.
The group_0 of old became werewolves. They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived. The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by character_0 for his location_1. For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity. And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for location_0 as my spirit home.
I've spent my twilight years trying to find a cure myself. And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us. They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity.

Another girl killed. The victim is character_1, from location_0. Served me a drink just a few nights ago... but I can't say I knew her.
She was killed the same way as the other two girls. Looks like she was stabbed, and then cut apart. It's like an animal got to her, but these are the wounds of a blade.
You could help us with the investigation. We're stretched thin as it is with the war. Nobody has the time to spend on this. Not pleasant, but it's the truth.
Here are some starting points for you. I noticed a trail of blood leading away from here. character_0's taken character_1's body into the task_location_0 to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knows anything, it's dead bodies.

If you are able to assist me, I will gladly pay you for your troubles.

He's a dragon. Not just any dragon, but the right hand of character_1, responsible for many atrocities during the ancient Dragon War. It's true that his crimes are long in the past, but justice does not count the passage of years.
Justice demands that he, character_0, dies for his crimes. Until he is dead, I'm afraid my oath as a group_0 prevents me from offering you aid and comfort.

I've given us a chance to speak privately, but I'm afraid I can't do this for long. We must be brief.
The situation here at your task_location_0 is of dire importance, and attempts to contact you as we have previously have failed. I believe it is due to the very source of our concern. This object... The item_0 as your people have taken to calling it. The energy coming from it has prevented us from reaching you with the visions you have already seen. The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with.
I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the character_0 here in your task_location_0. His perception may be more coherent than ours.

item_0

5th of First Seed, 4E 201
Idiots! character_1 and character_0 were at each others' throats again today, and nearly came to blows. The whole camp is on edge. I've ordered an extra ration of mead, but unless this fighting stops, we'll tear ourselves apart.

11th of First Seed, 4E 201
Rumor is that character_0's gathering followers for a mutiny. character_1's not stupid; he's probably doing the same, just for insurance. I'd kill them both myself, but the camp's split right down the middle. If I tried, there'd be a knife in my back within a week.
I can't take this anymore. I've begun skimming a little gold from the take, bringing it down here when I can. If I can scrape enough together, I'll make a run for it, head downriver to location_0.

28th of First Seed, 4E 201
character_1's getting suspicious -- I caught him poking around in the cove this afternoon. I don't think he found my stash, but it's not safe here. I took the boat out tonight and stowed it on the island to the south, by the old tree stump.
Had a good haul this week. Another caravan or two and I can finally get out of here, and not a moment too soon.

task_location_0 is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little things for honey. It's owned by some smart-mouth wood elf named character_0.
We had an arrangement with character_1. We kept an eye on task_location_0 to make sure the honey kept flowing. In return, character_1 allowed us to extort character_0 and bring in a huge payout.
task_location_0 brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You could almost call it our sweetest deal. Then out of the clear blue, character_0 stops sending us our cut. character_2 was... well, angry to put it kindly.
We need you to teach character_0 a lesson by burning down three of the estate's hives and clearing out the safe in the main house. The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground. character_1 would be furious if you did. She also prefers that character_0 remains alive, but if he tries to stop you from getting the job done, kill him.

I'm from from here. I've wandered a bit, but I always come back to location_0. My clan was one of the first to settle here.
Legend says that my forefather character_0 discovered the mines after he stumbled into a dark cave to relieve himself. Too much mead. Of course, there's another story of character_0 losing the family shield in a different cave, so it depends on who you believe.
According to my grandfather at least, the family shield should be in the cave. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old character_0 stumbled into: task_location_0. Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques.

When the colossus struck, item_0 was knocked from my grasp and I was wounded badly. It was only through blind luck that I was able to crawl away from the group_0 abomination and make my way to the surface.
I couldn't ask you to undertake such a treacherous journey, it would be a fool's errand. But I see that spark in your eye and I know better than to warn you away. item_0 rests with the group_0 ruin of task_location_0. Tread carefully, friend... those same ruins almost took my life.

When you offer the embrace, do so away from prying eyes. Our new sibling will then likely require rest while his blood undergoes the change. Return to me when your part is done.

One of the quickest ways to make some coin in location_1 is to clear out some of the wealthier homes of their valuables.
If you're interested, I could point out a good place that could use a little housecleaning by stealing three items of value.
The place in question is the task_location_0 in location_0. The people in this home recently got one of your fellow Guild mates sent to jail.
How about you make them pay for that? Just remember the order: do job first, get drunk second.

The group_0 will, no doubt, soon become even more of a nuisance now that item_0 has been recovered.
We need to strike a crippling blow against them before they muster more men against us. They've holed up in an abandoned fort in the Reach. The group_0 are apparently focused on exterminating vampires, noble and brute alike. Not a serious threat, but we can't leave them completely unchecked or they may become one.
But their time has come to an end. And you will be the one that ends it. Killing their leaders should discourage them from an out and out war with us.

You know that the staff is in task_location_0? Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there? That can't be a coincidence. The Arch-Mage. Before... before he died. He... He gave me something just a little while ago. He told me it was from task_location_0, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him. Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to character_1, but I think would do you the most good now. Take it, and get out of here.

Ah character_0_0, character_0_1. Former queen of location_0 and one of the most dangerous necromancers in recorded history. She was responsible for the Empire's near collapse almost five hundred years ago. I believe I have a book about her...
And now character_0_0 has been summoned in spirit form. Summoned in spirit form is not raised from the dead. She'll need help before she can return to the living.
For the moment, character_0_1 has retreated to a place filled with dead eager to serve her. She has gone to her old task_location_0. A few days ago, one of her servants busted through a wall into the Temple of Divines. We'll need you to go into the task_location_0 themselves.
You were there when character_0_0 was summoned. Being at the summoning created a connection to character_0_0, you are the one to stop her from returning to the living. I can provide you with some help with her minions.
As to character_0_0 herself, find what's left of her body, likely a skeleton. Remove it from the task_location_0 and bring it back to be sanctified by character_1.

If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole. You can keep the reward_0 after I have repaired it. I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of character_0's obsession, and how it consumed him.

It's a copy of the character_0's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see! Seems to be a message from the character_0 to one character_2. I've tracked character_2 to the keep in location_0. It would seem he's the cook.
You are to obtain that information from character_2 - who the character_0 really is, and where he can be found. Oh, and when you're done with character_2, kill him. Loose ends and all that.
As I was saying... You'll need to kill the character_0, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place. Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better.

Look, this mold is irreplaceable. I'll pay you well for its return and I can also prove to be quite a valuable ally to the group_0.  The only thing I can tell you is that the mold was taken to the bandit's hideout... a small cottage called task_location_0.

character_0's bandit gang dug up task_location_0: character_0 took the reward_0 from the monument within
character_1 keeps muttering about a character_2, who is going to kill all of character_0's bandits if they do not return the reward_0

item_0
by quest_giver

Night shift woke me to say they'd hit something big. character_0, character_1, and I went down to take a look. It's huge, like a whole forest was just swallowed up by the earth, with a big old monument out in the center. character_0 took a sword from the monument as a trophy and dubbed it the "reward_0", proof his whole plan was finally paying off. For once, he might be right.

character_1's been having nightmares over the past few days. He keeps muttering about a "character_2" - one of those swamp women who steal children away at night, I think. To think some fool story could turn the toughest bandit I know into a cowering kitten, frightened of his own shadow. I'm just glad none of the others see him like this.

It's getting worse. character_1 can barely sleep at all now, and whenever he dozes off, he wakes up screaming - woke the whole place last night. He says the "character_2" is coming for us - she's down in the forest, we have to return the sword or she'll kill us all. Not a chance - the boss clings to that thing like he was born with it. I've told everyone character_1 just has a fever, but this can't go on. I've pulled a few things together. I'll slip out tonight and never look back.

Hmm. Well, why don't you see if you can assist character_0? He's one of our scholars, here working on cataloging our finds.
I expect he'd appreciate some help in locating any additional magical artifacts here in the ruins. Any enchanted items will do; the usefulness of the enchantment is irrelevant. If you find anything, the class can look it over.

The entire town is being plagued by horrible nightmares. They're in serious danger but I'm afraid there's little I can do about it.
These dreams are manifestations created by character_0. She has an awful hunger for our memories. In return, she leaves behind nightmares, not unlike a cough marks a serious illness. I must end her terrible influence over these people before the damage becomes permanent.
I need to return to the source of the problem, to location_1. Perhaps you'd be willing to assist me in that regard? I've already said too much. If anyone overhears what we're saying, it could start a panic. I would simply ask that you trust me and help me end location_0's nightmares.
location_1 is only a short walk from location_0. Come, we must hurry.

They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not to pay. I want you to explain to them the error of their ways. Do this right, and I can promise you a permanent place in our organization.
Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is that you get the message across that we aren't to be ignored. A word of warning though... I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.

Scattered across location_1 are secluded locations known only as location_0. There's one in location_2, in the Pine Forest.
Performing the Ritual of the group_0 within the glade should provide the answers you seek. It involves carefully removing the bark from a Canticle Tree which will in turn attract group_0 to you.
In keeping with tradition, you must use a specific tool in the location_0, an implement known as a Draw Knife. Every Moth Priest is taught this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it... you should consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.
Once enough of the moths are following, they'll provide you with the second sight needed to decipher the item_1. From what I saw in the vision, the item_1 which foreshadows the defiance of the gods with the blood of mortals is the key to the prophecy.

Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to location_0. The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and character_0 scribbling in his journals.
He used to have a home in location_0 until they burned it down. The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform. After he made for task_location_0, he was never heard from again.
In his later years, character_0 moved into some ice caves known as task_location_0. He preferred the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments.

Splendid. We're ready to begin. Or, more specifically, you're ready to begin. After all, you're the one the character_2 spoke to.
Now then. I hope you have something nice to wear. Because you're going to a wedding. Well, more like the public reception. It should be a lovely affair. You'll mingle with the guests, eat some cake... stab the bride.
Oh yes. You've got to kill the bride. At her wedding. And they say romance is dead. Your target's name is character_1. She oversees the group_2's business holdings in location_0. The wedding is being held in that city, at the task_location_0. Her death will cause an uproar, which is exactly what we want.
character_1 is the first cousin to our dear Emperor, character_0. character_1 has obvious Imperial connections. Her husband has ties to the group_1. Their union is a step toward reconciliation. So if there's a murder at the wedding... Not only will it stall the peace process - it will send shockwaves throughout the entire Empire. The Emperor's hand will be forced. He'll have to travel to location_1 to deal with the aftermath... and he'll find the group_0 waiting.
character_1 is likely to address her guests frequently, as is the wedding custom. Kill her when she does that, and I promise you a significant bonus.
Now go. And give the city of location_0 a celebration they're not likely to forget.

There's a plot. Not against me. Against all of location_0. Those Imperial bastards are spying on every one of us.
Last night I saw character_0 the blacksmith writing a letter. Probably sending word to location_2 and character_1. Are you loyal to location_1? Break into character_0's house and get that letter.
The Empire is probably making character_0 smith up more swords and armor for them.

I found the ring's resting place, task_location_0, after he died, but I'm far too old to go exploring some cave, now. I'd be happy to give you some alchemy training in exchange for the ring, if you bring it to me.

If you can travel there, and retrieve our young character_0, your transgression will be forgiven. We believe the place in our vision to be task_location_0. Now move quickly. The girl must be brought to the temple as soon as possible.
You, my dear, can earn the blessing of character_1 as your reward.

He was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love. See, character_1 was involved with a pretty young woman named character_0. The two of them were very happy together, I thought. One day, she just disappeared. character_1 was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind. He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day.
I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together. I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could. character_1 seemed convinced that character_0'd run off to task_location_0 with someone named character_2. That's all I remember.

How quickly you've advanced. Most impressive. There are spells yet to be learned, powerful spells that can more closely and more permanently bind creatures to your will. These spells are difficult, even for one as skilled as I. To even begin to inscribe them, I need something very special. A sigil stone from an Oblivion gate.
I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a character_0 to retrieve one for us. You will summon one, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you.
But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound character_0. Summoning an Unbound character_0 is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding. You must first prove you are in control.
I will teach you the spell to summon the character_0, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event. Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the location_0; I have prepared a place for you there.

Sorry, the task_location_0's dry right now. What's wrong with the mine, you might ask. It's full of spiders, that's what's wrong with it!
Almost killed character_0 and me when they showed up. I'm worried that they'll come out of the mine looking for food soon... then we're in even bigger trouble.
You'd  clear them out for us? Tell you what. Keep to your word, and I'll line your pockets with as much as I can scrape up.

It's easy to find things to sell. Things nobody will miss. Things from underground, or just left lying around in someone's house. I bet the two of us, we're very alike. So why not take the next step? We can help each other.
My sister character_0 and I are treasure hunters. You could be too. We like to collect things. We are not thieves. We just take what will not be missed. What no one needs anymore. Maybe we take some weapons and stop a few deaths. Who would call that thievery?
With the war, many more ships come through these docks. Loaded with weapons and pay, but few people. And they pass through dangerous waters. We have an interest in one of those boats, the location_0. The task_location_0 will be guiding it in... but if its fire were to go out, the location_0 would run aground.
If someone were to put out the lighthouse fire and then meet me on the docks afterwards... I could certainly direct them to that loot. That someone could be you.

item_0
by quest_giver

How to summarize a lifetime of research? So little of what I have learned matters now - the petty politics of ancient times, the age-long campaign to wipe out all mention of the character_0 name.
In the opening days of the First Era, the character_0 was revered throughout the north. Wisdom, wealth, honor, and power were his, and even the legendary heros' heirs sought his counsel.
Smothered by his shadow, character_0's three sons grew cruel and resentful. They lusted after their father's power and prestige, and eventually character_2, the eldest, discovered its source: a mysterious amulet, from which he never parted. Together, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his amulet between them. And so it was done.
Consumed by their newfound power, the brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages. So great was the carnage that the High King himself intervened, sending a company of battlemages led by the character_4 to subdue the brothers. And after a devastating battle, the three fled the field.
character_1, the youngest, was run to ground in task_location_0, the ancient barrows at the foot of location_0. character_4 pursued character_2 to the shattered crypts of task_location_1, half-buried even then. And at last, character_3 was cornered in the southernmost reaches of land and later entombed in task_location_2.

<|begin_description|>
I am a sea captain by inheritance, as my men are fond of saying. Can't blame them, my mother ran the location_1 as strictly as she ran the house.
I've been trying to find new areas of business, trying to win the sailors' respect, but I keep having problems. Take the last trade we did. Some item_0 from the location_0. Plenty of coin if you know who to sell it to.
What happened to the Salts? Sailors are what happened to them. They got drunk and ended up losing the merchandise in some cave. If you're not afraid of little exploring, I'll pay good gold to get those Salts.

Oh. You read the book, didn't you? item_0? It was my theory, you know. My research. My life's work. All of it, lost! Stolen by my own damn apprentice! That's how I ended up here. I can't rest. Not until I find the item_1, until I can prove that it was my discovery. Mine, not his!
Hmm... well, you can pick up where I left off. My notes should still be in my journal, if you can read it. We still have to find the Forge itself. I had a lead on that, too.

A lot of our kind block out the memory of their first meal. The shame is too much. But you don't need to hide anymore. character_0_0, the character_0_1, accepts you for what you are.
She has a place for us, where we can sate our appetites without judgment. It's inside task_location_0. But the dead have stirred from their slumber recently, and I was forced here. Meet me there. We will fight our way to character_0_0's embrace together.

A fellow Breton who went by the name character_0 showed up on my doorstep about a fortnight ago. He stole something from me: my own formula for improved bonemold. Took me years to perfect.
Before he ran off, he was talking some nonsense about trying to fence goods to the group_1 at task_location_0. I told him he was crazy to even think about talking to those vicious little buggers, but he wouldn't listen. I'd bet a fat purse of coin that he's either dead or hiding out up there.

No, he went into the forbidden wing of the palace, to speak with an old friend. Said it had been ages since they had last had tea. Oh and you'll need the hip bone... it's very important.

character_0's taken to locking himself in the character_1's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones. Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery. As the character_1's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary. character_0 will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even. Ironically, the character_1 could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.
I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting. It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look. Like inside the character_1's coffin.

It may be cold, but you can't beat the tranquility of the watching icebergs to live out your silver years. character_0 loves the place too, despite the occasional leaky ceiling. character_2 and character_1, unfortunately, seem miserable here; I know the kids are old enough to strike out on their own, but I hope they'll grow to love the peace and quiet here as I have.
character_2 and character_1 continue to bicker and harass each other and they seem to have started in on their mother as well. character_0 keeps finding things missing from the cellar. character_1 said she heard a noise down there but character_2 just thinks their mother is going mad from isolation. The very thought of it is ridiculous, she's always wanted to retire here!
character_1 keeps saying that she hears scratching coming from the cellar at night. I think she's just trying to get her mother's goat, but I'd better head into town to get a few traps just in case it's rats. Should only take a couple days. I just hope those two go easy on character_0 while I'm gone.
Oh gods. Oh gods why? I returned home to find my beautiful character_0 killed and this thing, this horrible bug-like creature ransacking our home. I managed to kill the damned thing, I think it might be a demon! I've never seen anything like it! Oh gods poor character_0. It must have come out of the cellar. I'm going down there and locking the door behind me to make sure they don't escape. I don't know if I'll make it out, but I have to save my family!

By the gods! I know this looks bad. Let me explain...
I called task_location_0 home, now I know that was a mistake. I am, or was part of a coven serving the group_0 that live there. So was she.
We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked me. I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill. We needed a sacrifice for the Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things, group_0. I can't be a part of that. Gods, I can't run away from this.
I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing. Follow me. We have to fight our way up the task_location_0. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart.

Mark my words, these mines hold a secret that could put location_0 back on the map. A secret the group_0 swept under the rug two centuries ago. It killed my great-grandfather, character_0, and left location_0 with a worthless and tainted mine.
group_0 called it "a terrible accident", claiming that he was lost in a rockfall, but I know better. My wife and I were cleaning out our home, and we came across some of my great-grandfather's things locked in an old chest. I found an unsent letter he'd written to the group_0, and a key.
The letter describes a discovery that was made in the mine by some of the diggers. They wanted character_0 to take a closer look. The group_0 must have felt it was of great value, as they locked that section of the mine off from everyone else. I assume the key unlocks that section of the mine. I haven't been able to find the entrance.
I'm telling you... there's something big down there, something that the group_0 wanted to hide from everyone.

item_0
by quest_giver

The missing students were found in the location_0 this morning. Dead, as expected. None of us bothered keeping a detect life charm for the search at this point.
The bodies were found together, each suffering the same deformities; peeled and bubbling skin on the arms and face. Conjurer's burn, as it's commonly referred to around the location_1. There's little doubt they were attempting a summoning ritual well beyond their capabilities.
The relic nearby put any doubt in this theory to rest. I admit that I've never seen one like it - a large, segmented sculpture of a gauntlet, the Daedric sigil 'O' emblazoned upon the palm. Attempts to move it were in vain. I must show it to the Archmage during his upcoming visit. Perhaps he will know more.
While we couldn't move the relic, I was able to pry number_0 "rings" from it. I'm sure there's a connection between them and the ritual the students were attempting.
I'll store these in the task_location_0 until we can consult with a conjuration master to learn more.

You'd think an apprentice could forge a few hinges. Not character_0. I keep showing him how to treat the iron, but he never gets it.
In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess. If you find a book called item_0, could you bring it to me? character_0 sure isn't learning by example.
Books. Don't know why the Imperials like them so much. It should help the boy, though, Malacath willing. Bring the book, and I'll show you how an Orc learns to smith.

From the lore I've been able to piece together, there is a secret way to her hidden realm. The spirit, character_1, can open the way - but he may ask for something in return. You'll have to journey to the task_location_0 in the north. Search for the shrines that mark character_1's resting place. I hope this helps you on your way! I'll keep researching in hopes of finding more information to help you.

My husband character_0 and I were on our way to the location_0. We're homesteaders, with a small farm in the Frosted Hills. The weather is getting harsh, so we were making one last run for supplies before winter. Oh, I'm beside myself with worry! Please, find character_0 and our precious babies! You have to help us! You could have a special item as a token of our gratitude!

The character_1 and the character_2 might be formidable, but even their combined powers are nothing more than parlor tricks to one such as me. I can easily undo anything that they have done to your "character_0." I will of course require something in return.
My only real enemy in this desert is boredom. I will make you a bargain: Perform three tasks for my amusement. If your struggles provide suitable entertainment, then, and only then, will I free your character_0.
Your first task: Journey to the task_location_0, and recover my item_0 from the group_0!

Thank you for rescuing me. I had recovered the Passkey Ember from these slavers, but they captured me as I was trying to return to the Enclave.
I could use your help with one small matter before you go. These slavers have been harrying the group_0 for several weeks now. You defeated many, but there are many more watching us from the safety of those huts. Burn them out! If they are allowed to remain, the location_0 will never be safe.

We must act quickly. It appears that the character_0 you defeated in the Vaults has enslaved the character_2 for the enemy. The most pressing danger is that they will use the enslaved character_2 to corrupt... and control... all the world's magic. Our only recourse in that event may be to destroy the character_2.
There might still be hope. If we can find a way to free the character_2 from group_0's control, we can thwart the character_1's plans.

Let us return to the matter of the character_0. He has now stolen the energy of three group_0, and we thought he desired my power as well. But, for some reason, he has left the desert, and is now en route to location_0.
That can only mean that he is bound for the reward_0. With the power he has amassed, he could destroy the barrier between our world and the realm of the group_1. They would pour through by the millions.

Please, traveler! Wait a moment! I am quest_giver - a traveler from location_0. My father and I came to this place to recover an ancient artifact - the item_0 - which is said to have power over death itself. We sought to bring it to the location_1 for study.
My father entered the catacombs while I tended our camp - but he has not returned, and there are dark things stirring below.
Please - I only ask that you discover his fate - perhaps he is wounded and only needs aid to escape!
If the worst comes to pass... he wears a locket around his neck, and you will know him by it.

I wish you had gotten here sooner! The character_0 came through here about an hour ago. He laid waste to the camp and then went through the location_0, there - sealed it shut behind him.
We believe that door leads to the item_0. We've been unable to open it ourselves, but we know how in theory. See that dwarven automaton? It's designed to open the door, but it's missing its Power Source. There should be one in the task_location_0, but it was too dangerous for us to enter. Perhaps you will have more luck.

My ancient charge, to guard the gate
The desert sands to contemplate.

Part drake, part lion: enemy_0.
Lay its skin before my eyes
And passage through shall be your prize.
