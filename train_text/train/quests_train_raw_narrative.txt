I'm sorry for all of this hiding and skulking, but there are dire events afoot. You know that I am one of the principal shareholders of the Merchants' League. Well, I share ownership of the company with two others: Irlentree and Zorl Miyar, two very distinguished gentlemen. When I returned from my hunting trip — thanks to you, I might add — I found that my two partners had undergone some profound changes, nothing physical or overt, but something far more sinister.
It's as if my partners had become wholly different people while I was gone. They almost take an active interest in squandering our company's resources on frivolous and stupid ideas. If they continue on this course, the company will be in shambles in but a few weeks. I know you have already helped me once, but I ask for your assistance again. I have no other recourse.
Come into the Merchants' League Estate with me. I will explain that you are an old friend of mine and will quarter you in the guest chambers. From there, please investigate my partners, perhaps using magic or any of the other skills you possess. Learn as much as you can during your visit and then report back to me after you're done. It should only take a couple of days."

Alas, he has neither the brains nor the ability. Such is a mother's lot in life, however, to watch her children perform acts of idiocy despite her warnings or concerns.
He and his thick-skulled cohorts took it upon themselves to plumb the depths of Durlag's Tower. They bought a ward token from that shyster, Galken, and made ready to leave. Though I begged and cried, Dalton still insisted on going. The band never returned. I fear that they were destroyed by the mad dwarf's machinations. That is the tale, sad but true.
Please find my son if he still lives."

Things have not always been like this. Brynnlaw was once a pleasant town, though my memories may be influenced by happier times in my own life.
Then the pirates arrived, led by the despot Desharik. Desharik had lost a war with another pirate king. Forced to this island, his ships invaded the town. They took our homes. Desharik killed our mayor and dumped his body into the sea. We were forced out into the streets.
My father could take no more injustice. He tried to get back into our house and was executed for breaking the law of the pirates. Once they've stolen something, the owner has no claim on it.
Desharik said that we would have to pay for our father's "crime." He gave us to Chremy, his lieutenant, as a reward for service. He put me to work as a courtesan for the drunken pirates. It's horrible, traveler! He says that he'll kill my brother Ason if I don't do it.
There is no escape for Ason and me. There is a smuggler who will take us, but we cannot afford to pay him. There is nowhere to run on this island.
Chremy can be found near the inn. The smuggler's name is Calahan. I hope that Calahan will take us with him when you kill Chremy. He will be near the docks. Please be careful!"

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Hello once again!
It is pleasing to see that you did not respond to the call of that harlot, Lilith Lurraxol. The woman is too deluded to see the truth, as I said. A commoner that has risen above her station. Our two houses have been feuding for generations. The Lurraxols seem to be possessed of the notion that their family founded this town... what an absurd thought!
Why they would even presume to suppose such a thing, I have no idea. It is sad, however, that the Alibakkars have never had the evidence to prove our claim to them... though it galls me that we would need it. All that has recently changed. An old tome belonging to my family states that there is proof — that proof can be found right here in Trademeet. In the graveyard is a tomb that has been long abandoned... but which also houses the founder of the town. My ancestor. With him lies a large circlet called the Mantle of Waukeen.
Possessing that circlet would be all the proof I need, so I wish to acquire it. I would do so myself, but there happens to be a good reason the tomb is abandoned. It is... haunted, so they say. The exact nature of its danger I do not know... but you are a hero who surely could face its perils and return safely with the mantle, yes? In return, I shall pay you 1,000 gold. I shall give you the key, then, which will allow you into the tomb... the key itself having been in my family for some time as well. More proof, yes? Go, then, and return with the mantle."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Ah! It is the hero of Trademeet, come to see me at last. I trust that all is well? That pig, Skarmaen Alibakkar, did not speak too harshly about me, I trust? No matter. He is a stubborn, deluded fool. Our families have been at odds for generations, you see. The Alibakkars refuse to acknowledge the fact that we are the only true noble family in Trademeet, having founded it. Why they would think themselves higher than they are is beyond my ken. What is unfortunate, however, is that my family has never had actual, physical proof of the truth of our claim.
That has changed, however. A tome has recently been uncovered... an old tome belonging to my family... that states there is proof right here in Trademeet under our noses. In the graveyard, here in town, lies the crypt of the founder... my ancestor. With him lies the Mantle of Waukeen. A pretty name for an old gold circlet. That circlet, however, would prove my claim once and for all and shut those Alibakkars up. I would get it myself, but the tomb is haunted, you see. Here is the key to the tomb... the fact that we possess it is yet more proof of our legitimacy. Use it to enter and obtain the mantle, and then return to me when you are done.
You are a hero who might enter that tomb and retrieve the circlet for me, if you are willing. In return, I will pay you 1,000 gold. What do you say, my hero?"

He has been trying to muscle into a relationship with the Shadow Thieves, and while we could pay, it is better that we send a message to any of his cohorts. I have come here with a promise of granting his wishes, but I only want to lure him away from his palisade defenses. This is where you come in.
Sir Greshal wishes to be introduced to a contact here in the city, and that contact will be you. The meeting is already set up, and when he arrives, we will take him by surprise. You are known somewhat in this place, if not as a guildmaster. He will believe you are a legitimate contact. He seems willing to believe anything, so long as it is theatrical.
It will be any evening that is best for you. I will await you in Waukeen's Promenade after dark and then dispense a runner to get Sir Greshal. The suddenness will seem dramatic to him."

There were svirfneblin observing my conflict: Perhaps they took it. I cannot blame them. I am sure I appeared quite permanently lost.
I believe there is a svirfneblin village to the north. They may have taken my gear there. If you go, tell them they may keep everything but the book."

At first, I suspected Hectan... he is well known about town for his sticky fingers. But after questioning many witnesses, it is clear that Hectan was at the local pub from dusk until dawn the night of the theft. I still suspect that no-good thief Hectan was involved — I can clearly see the guilt in his face! But there is no proof. Without my spellbook, I am virtually powerless to pursue this myself, and as a newcomer to this town, I have no one to turn to for help.
I regret that there is little else I can tell you. Hectan can usually be found in the Tankard Tree if you wish to question him.
I urge you godspeed."

He also mentioned Belgrade, a merchant that helped expose Ployer. He frequents the Copper Coronet, and the bartender Bernard might know his whereabouts.
My very bones ache today. It is as though I age on the inside. Ohh, this cannot go on for long. We must remove this curse!"

"Now I ask for a more specific task that will disrupt the Shadow Thieves further.
The task is... unseemly.
It calls for the murder of a man. Not a truly innocent man, but hardly a villain of epic scope. You must kill, blaming the murder on the Shadow Thieves. He is head of a merchant house, and his link to Shadow Thieves is blatant. If he were to die and certain gear were at the scene, it would implicate the guild we oppose.
Take this cloak and dagger, and go kill Senior Armagaran Vulova. When he is dead, put the cloak and dagger in the fountain in his house. He will die easily, though there may be guards. His small house is in the Government District, between the jail and the government building.
Go."

The genies will allow no trade to occur until Ihtafeer is found and her head given to them. Why... why they have chosen this particular tactic, I am unsure.
Without proper trade, however, the merchants are penniless. Soon, the food resources will dry up as well, so something must be done... and done soon.

"My name is Captain Samand, and I'm a very busy man right now.
A few days ago, someone opened a secret gate into the town — Saradush could easily have been overrun. We just discovered the traitor was a young man named Mateo. There's no doubt in my mind that *someone* betrayed us. The enemy came through a small sewer outlet that was protected by both a locked iron grate and several powerful magical wards. There is no way to open that entrance from the outside. But Mateo is a faithful soldier, not the type of man to betray Saradush.
An alarm was raised, and my soldiers arrived only a few moments after the gate was opened. We found three soldiers in the area: Mateo, Ardic Santele, and the merchant Kiser Jhaeri. We didn't get a chance to complete our investigations. Ardic, the son of the Countess Santele, disappeared. He was our primary witness. Our attention was focused on the vile Kiser Jhaeri, but we had no proof. Then the countess told us that Ardic, her son, had implicated Mateo before he disappeared.
If you wish to investigate further, I will not stand in your way. Speak to Mateo in his cell. The jailer will let you see him."

As I said before, my name is Marlowe... I hail from Calimshan to the south, where I was a merchant. A successful one. I... suppose that is where I first came into contact with Vongoethe.
Vongoethe is a lich, adventurer. A powerful one. In Calimshan, there are many strange wonders of magic, and Vongoethe is not out of place. It is he who has chased us here, hunting us mercilessly. Vongoethe desired my poor Malla, my daughter. She is the young woman here on the bed. A... a good girl, a virgin and pure of heart. He desired her soul, he said, so I fled Calimshan with her. But he caught up to us nevertheless. And somehow he has taken her soul despite my efforts! She... she lies near death, and there is nothing the local priestess can do to help her. I know Vongoethe is in the cavern that serves as a graveyard in this place. I told the monks about him... but they sealed off the cavern rather than somehow getting my daughter's soul back as I had hoped.
Malla is the world to me! And I do not know how much longer Vongoethe will remain trapped in that cavern... he could already be loose! He will kill me and keep Malla's soul, I am sure of it!
Getting inside the cavern is not a problem. I... paid the guard there what little money I have left. I had thought to... try and get Malla's soul myself. But the guard will let in whomever I ask him to.
I have no coin left to offer you. I have bankrupted myself in trying to flee the lich's reach. But... Vongoethe himself is a powerful wizard. Surely he has items that would interest you, that you could take from him!"

You know of the prevailing attitude against magic here in Amn, yes? Well, amongst some it is even worse than that... a burning, palpable hatred. One particular man here in Athkatla has murdered two of our number in cold blood. He is currently in hiding, and we need you to track the fellow down. We have been unable to do so, much to our frustration. Cowled Wizards cannot be assaulted without repercussions or it will lead to... serious problems.
He is Valygar Corthala, last son of a wealthy family and a true brute. Ask around and you may discover if he is hiding within the city or someplace else. He has a home here in the Docks District, or he may have fled to the Umar Hills. His friends and servants will not speak to us, but they may to you.
We do not ask that you commit any murder. We wish Valygar be delivered to us, that is all. He will likely resist, so if you must kill him, so be it. But if you do kill him, I simply must have his body. Valygar must be delivered to us whether he is dead or alive. You understand, yes?"

Had a book written about him, in fact! I don't have a copy myself, but there was one in First Edition last time I was browsing there. At least some people take an interest in history."

"Weathered Journal
by Vangaril

Long have I sought to purge the evils haunting Erandur. Even when his necromantic studies resulted in our mutual expulsion from the Guild of Mages, I persisted in guiding him towards good with a gentle hand. Alas, in our exile, my old friend has mired himself in the foul practice, and in shocking discovery I learned he had become a miserly disciple of the Worm King, a cunning wraith. A Lich.
Frail memory strengthened by dogmatic resolve, the Archmages turned me away when I came to them with my discovery. My pleas for a detachment of battlemages ignored, only my long-past expulsion remembered. And thus, the grave duty falls only to me. I must bear the burden of purging the Lich that was once a friend.
I wander now into the foreboding maw of these catacombs known as the Lost Boy Caverns, far from the climes of common elves and men. With pure spirit and rites of cleansing, I hope to strike down the fearsome Lich and set free the soul of Erandur, but I leave this testament behind, lest I may never return from these depths; as a warning to those who may follow my path.
Faithful, even in Exile,
Vangaril"

I brought you... Sir Roderic shouted for me to take them... the Greaves of the Crusader. The holy Relic. They're yours. The wraith used the Sword of the Crusader against Sir Roderic. I don't know how that evil thing could use the holy weapon, but it did.
You must avenge Sir Roderic by killing the foul wraith and get yourself the Sword of the Crusader!"

"Excuse me. I'm innkeeper Diram Serethi. We have a small problem that we hope you can help us with.
You may be wondering why you can't see me. We are all wondering the same thing. Everyone in Aleswell suddenly became invisible several weeks ago. It was sort of fun at first, but the novelty has definitely worn off now. You can imagine how difficult it is to run an inn while invisible. Once you get a reputation as a haunted inn, you can just forget about it. So we've all been keeping quiet, hoping the spell will wear off. But we're running out of patience. We're sure it was Ancotar's doing, but we can't find him. If you can help us, we will be extremely grateful.
Ancotar's a wizard who took up residence in the ruins of Fort Caractacus a couple of years ago. He's caused us no end of trouble with his magical experiments, but nothing as bad as this. We've tried to find him, but had no luck. If he's still living in the fort, he's hiding from us, and no wonder. If you could find him and get him to remove this cursed invisibility, we will all be in your debt. The ruined fort is just to the southeast of here. Follow the path down the hill. But watch out for the invisible monsters that infest the ruins!
If you make us visible again, you'd be welcome at the Aleswell Inn anytime. Free of charge."

Well, if you're dead set on learning something from me, then how about you do a little something for me, first? Something for her, to be honest.
I'd like to get her a gift of a sort. Nothing terribly fancy, and something useful... How about a nice silver pitcher, and a set of four glasses. Here's 50 gold to cover the costs, that should be more than enough. Come see me when you've got everything, and we'll talk more."

Weatherleah was our family's home for generations. Our parents fled it when ogres attacked; they became separated. My father carried me to safety. He later returned and believed Reynald and my mother had perished. Since ogres are cannibals, he didn't expect to find their bodies. Thankfully, however, it seems that my mother managed to carry Reynald to safety. While my mother didn't survive, Reynald did, and for that I'm grateful.
But we both want more - we want our home back. We're not fighters; you appear to have more skill than either of us. Would you go to Weatherleah, and see if it's still inhabited by ogres?
Now, we're not quite sure where the estate is located. We'll offer up what we know, however. We believe it's somewhere south of Chorrol, but southwest of Fort Carmala. It may be difficult to find. Since no one's lived there for many years, it may be quite overgrown by now.

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"I'm Ursanne. I'm sorry to impose upon you like this, but I'm in need of assistance, and I don't know what to do. My husband, Aleron, is missing.
It all started when Aleron became foolish, and started gambling. He'd visit the arena every week and spend our hard earned money on bets. I told him to stop, but he didn't listen. He was certain he could win us a fortune and move us somewhere nicer, like the Imperial City. It didn't take long for Aleron to begin losing. He resorted to borrowing money from a usurer to cover his losses and place new bets. As you can imagine, it didn't pay off. He ended up owing around 500 gold. We could never have that kind of money to pay back the usurer.
Yesterday, the usurer, Kurdan gro-Dragol, sent for my husband to meet him at the Lonely Suitor Lodge. He hasn't returned since. I fear for his life. Kurdan isn't known for his patience. Please, I'm not wealthy, but I'd give anything to see Aleron again. Please, find Aleron.
Farewell, and be careful, Kurdan is not to be trusted."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Here's the deal. Jorundr and I have had a rocky relationship at best.
Against my will, I've been dragged all over Cyrodiil helping him commit petty crimes. I wouldn't say we're thieves. I mean, we've stolen things... sure. But we've never stolen that much at one time. Just enough to keep us going. That is, until last year.
Jorundr started to take risks and began robbing more dangerous targets. Not just lone merchants, mind you. I'm talking about the bigger scores. Like estates and tax shipments. I begged him to stop, as I knew that his capers would one day lead to violence. He just threatened to... hurt me if I got in his way. I think the gold changed him. I really do. He wasn't the man I met seven years ago. The few times I tried to say something, he'd strike me or push me away. I began to become frightened of him.
Our last score was a tax shipment being delivered to the Imperial City. We robbed it, and in the midst of the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard. I was mortified. We snatched up the gold and holed up in the mountains. He said if I breathed a word of the murder to anyone, he'd kill me. I was terrified of him at this point. Two days later, the Bruma City Guard traced us to our makeshift campsite. I was off gathering food, but Jorundr was captured. Served him right. When I went back to the site later, the gold was gone! He'd moved it! What I need you to do is go to the Bruma Castle Dungeons and speak to him for me. Convince him to tell you where the gold is and then we split it."

Rythe likes to work in his studio with the door locked, so no one can disturb him. He usually comes out to eat dinner and sleep, but two days ago, he didn't come out at all. At first, I wasn't worried. He does that occasionally. But when he didn't come out for a full day, I unlocked the studio with the key he said to use only in emergencies. It turned out he wasn't inside! I'm sure he never left that room. So I have no idea where he's gone.
Please. Help me find Rythe. I love him dearly, and I am so worried. Here's the key to Rythe's studio. You may come and go as you please. If you need me, I'll be around the house."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"This is the big one. This is the heist that will be written about and talked about for decades to come. We are going to steal one of the Elder Scrolls from the Imperial Palace. Are you ready for this challenge?
There is no buyer. This is for glory, not for money. Our names will become legend. I also have a personal need for this particular scroll. As for your compensation, I ask you to trust me. If my plan works, you will get a reward worth far more than mere money.
I have worked for eleven years planning this heist. Savilla's Stone provided the last bit of information I needed. The Elder Scrolls are kept in the Imperial Palace behind a door that cannot be breached. Savilla's Stone has revealed a path around this door. You will have to travel the Old Way. Once used as an escape route for Imperial Emperors, it has been forgotten for centuries.
The Old Way can be found in the Imperial Sewers. Here is the key for the gate to that section of the sewers. My scrying with Savilla's Stone has provided clues, but not the details. I know the tools you will need there, but not the obstacles themselves. The Boots of Springheel Jak will allow you to leap to an unreachable place. They will also protect you from a long fall. The Arrow of Extrication is the only way to unlock the final door. Take them both.
Once you are inside the Palace itself, you need to find the reading room. The blind priests will deliver a scroll to you there. I arranged for the notable Celia Camoran to want to read a particular Elder Scroll. Don't ask how. However, she will be... unavoidably detained. You will take her place. Do not speak to the priests. They are blindfolded and will not realize it isn't her unless you speak. As the guildmaster, I am waiving bloodprice for anyone you kill during this heist. However, I can't stop the Watch from putting a price on your head.
I have written it all down for you in this book. I've chosen you because you are the best. Good luck."

You, dear Silencer, will help put her family at peace.
You are to go to Gnoll Mountain, locate Havilstein Hoar-Blood, and send his soul to the great beyond.
When Hoar-Blood has been executed, journey to the ancient ruin of Nornal. In the flooded section of that ruin you will find a chest, submerged in the water. As you may have guessed, the chest contains your reward for killing Havilstein Hoar-Blood, 500 gold, and your next contract."

She and I have had our differences over the years, I admit. Now she is taking this opportunity to get her revenge. I believe that you may be able to persuade her to part with the item, where I cannot due to her prejudice against me. Her name is Herminia Cinna. She lives here in the Imperial City, in the Elven Gardens district.
I hope you will succeed where I have so far failed. Afterwards, in order to bring my research on the last king of the Ayleids to its final stage, I need to go to the Throne Room of Nenalata. While I am not without means of defending myself, I believe you would be an invaluable companion on such an expedition. Your reward will be whatever plunder you wish to carry off from Nenalata. Since the Throne Room has been sealed since the time of the Ayleids, it should provide rich pickings."

Apparently the wine is so rare because it was only made in one tiny batch. It's the product of an alchemist who was also a vintner. Besides tasting incredible, the magic within the wine allows the imbiber to be gifted with Night Eye! The vintner made it special for the Legion soldiers posted at the forts when they were active long ago. It was perfect for keeping lookouts warm on cold nights and helping them see better in the dark.
If you can retrieve six bottles of Shadowbanish Wine, I'll gladly pay you well: 1,000 gold. All I know about them is that they're found in the many fort ruins scattered all over Cyrodiil."

"I'm sorry. We've not met. I'm Janus Hassildor, Count of Skingrad. I understand you're looking for a cure for vampirism. This is fortunate, as I also seek the cure.
I wish to tell you a story so that you might understand why I would trust you with my secrets. More than 50 years ago, my wife Rona and I were both turned into vampires. While I came to embrace the changes in myself, she did not. She hated what she had become, and refused to feed to keep herself healthy. She eventually slipped into a coma from which she has not awoken. My trusted servants have cared for her all this time, but I wish for her to at last find peace. The cure is for her. I have researched what I can, but acquiring the cure is beyond my grasp. I cannot risk drawing too much attention to myself. So I would ask that you took up the search on my behalf. If you are successful, I will reward you in whatever small way I can. Will you aid me?
What little I have discovered points to the witches of Glenmoril. In the past, they have been capable of creating a cure. I have searched for these witches throughout Cyrodiil, but no covens still exist within its borders. There may be one left. I have unconfirmed reports of a woman seen near the Corbolo river, who fits the description of these witches. Seek her out, and learn whether she can help. She lives somewhere along the river, east of the Imperial City and south of Cheydinhal. If you are successful in finding a cure, report to my steward. You have my thanks."

by Daravyn the Gray

My love,
I write this with trembling hands. The guards are after me, and I have nowhere else to turn. Soon they will be at the doors to Rosethorn Hall, and nothing will keep them from taking me away back to that horrible prison. I don't know how they found me; perhaps it was that traitor, Delgariun. Whoever told them I was hiding in your home must have known both of us very well. I know Delgariun has eyes for you, I know he's the one that framed me in the first place and had me sent to that dank hole in the Imperial City. He has to be the one. Beware of him, my love. He's treacherous and only wants you to get to the treasure. I didn't give it up to the guards, and I won't give it up to Delgariun. I've hidden the treasure within the walls of Rosethorn Hall. Remember the toy we played with as we ran through this place as children?
Remember the riddle we had for it? It was our secret code: "Two bodies have I, though both joined in one. The more I stand still, the quicker I run."
The key to the treasure lies with the answer. Take care of it, my love. It is your ticket far from Delgariun. Do not fret, I've escaped once, I shall do so again. Soon we will be together, and the sun will shine upon us.
Daravyn the Gray"

My double is always working. It takes all my energy just watching him work. It's got to stop. It's a problem, all these doubles walking around. And it's tiresome. Didn't used to be like this.
Some blasted mage. Had a theory. They've always got theories. He thought there was a Manic and a Demented in each of us. So, what does he do? What else? Casts a spell. You can see how well that went. Two of each of us walking around this place. Nothing we can do about it, either. There's a law about that here. Been to the Hill of Suicides? Not a nice place. But you might be able to help.
Only one group can stick around. Either we Demented or those blasted Manics. It's the only way we'll find any peace. You get rid of those Manics. All of them. If you can take care of that for me, I'd make it worth your while.."

We need to gather what allies we can before Bruma is hopelessly besieged. If the Mythic Dawn manages to open a Great Gate here, the city will need a stronger garrison for there to be any hope of defending it.
You should speak to the rulers of the other cities of Cyrodiil, as well as the Elder Council. Ask them to send aid to Bruma before it is too late."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm Countess Narina Carvain. I assume you've noticed all of the Akaviri relics I'm displaying.
Well, it's safe to say I'm a collector of sorts. I've invested a great deal of time and money acquiring these bits of ancient history. In fact, I'd be so bold as to proclaim my collection the most complete in all Cyrodiil; perhaps even beyond. Except for one thing.
A particular relic has eluded me for many years. Possessing this piece of Akaviri antiquity would make my collection complete. I'm of course referring to The Draconian Madstone. The stone is a fine bit of Akaviri craftsmanship. Worn like an amulet, this talisman is said to protect the wearer from poisons of any type. The talisman appears as a snake coiled around and encircling itself. The eyes of the snake are supposed to be precious gems or some such. Through my sources, I've learned that the last reported location of the Draconian Madstone was the ruins at Pale Pass.
If you retrieve the Draconian Madstone for me, I'll be happy to compensate you by rewarding you with another Akaviri artifact. Are you in the game?
Let me tell you how you're going to find the talisman. I've come into the possession of a diary written by an Akaviri messenger. I suspect that the text within can lead you to the ruins. Here's a translation of the passages we could still read. It was quite damaged. I've also included a rough map that was drawn in the diary as well. I'm also providing you with a unique key that was supposedly found with the diary. I'm assuming it will prove useful when you arrive at the site."

I've been gathering things for quite a while, but there are still a few I'm missing. Perhaps you'd bring them to me? I still need the Amulet of Disintegration, the Ring of Desiccation, and, of course, the Calming Pants. Must have the Calming Pants. Bring these to me, and I will reward you well. Ahjazda has many, many things.
Let me teach you a special spell, Ahjazda's Paranoia, after you return with the items. It will affect all those around you. You might find it handy to cause confusion in your enemies. You know... when the time comes."

The time has come for you to fulfill your destiny. Umaril lies hid in the ancient fane of Garlas Malatar. You must go there and destroy him.

While beyond the power of most mortals, this is only the lesser of your two tasks. It will allow you to follow Umaril into the spirit realm upon his death. It will allow you to destroy him, body and soul, utterly and for all time."

You must infiltrate Fort Sutch, find Roderick's medicine, and replace it with a poisoned bottle I will provide. But you must remain undetected! Whomever arranged this contract wants it to look like Roderick died from his illness, so discretion is essential. Attack no one! Be seen by no one! If you are detected, the poisoning will fail, and Roderick must be killed in some other manner. That will, of course, forfeit your bonus.
Roderick may lie near death, but dead he is not. Until his soul has passed, our client -- and the Grim Reaper himself -- will not be satisfied."

You can see the marks on the ground where they were, with the Great Gate right in the middle. I sent men into the Gate, to see if they could find a way to shut it. They haven't come back. If you can get in there, find out what happened to them. If they're alive, help them finish the job. If not, see what you can do on your own.

Please, I'll give you six gems as a token of my gratitude. They're all I have left of value, but you must have them if you do the deed."

"We need a Great Sigil Stone. You're not going to like it. Jauffre doesn't like it. The Countess of Bruma certainly isn't going to like it. Great Sigil Stones are the anchors of Great Gates. The kind of gate the Mythic Dawn opened at Kvatch. The kind of Gate the Mythic Dawn wants to open here to destroy Bruma.
The risk is great, I know. I was at Kvatch. I saw the terrible power of the Daedric siege engine. But we have no choice. The only way to recover the Amulet of Kings is to allow the Mythic Dawn to proceed with their plan to attack Bruma.
Please, my friend. I explain myself to you so you understand me. And so you can explain to the Countess. I'm afraid she may take a bit more convincing than you.
Have the Countess of Bruma meet me in the Chapel of Talos for a council of war. That seems a fitting place to make such desperate plans."

There are some important facts concerning this quest. The player is the newest member of the Thieves Guild. Hieronymus Lex collected taxes from the Waterfront: the city usually doesn't bother collecting taxes from the Waterfront District, because it costs more money than its worth. The Gray Fox has always protected the poor of the Waterfront.
This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Ah! Our newest member. I'm glad you stopped by. I have a... situation that you might be able to help with.
The Gray Fox has asked me to take care of a problem, and I'm putting you on it. Hieronymus Lex actually collected taxes from everyone living here on the Waterfront! Your job is to recover those taxes.
The people of the waterfront are very poor. Traditionally the city has not collected taxes from them, even though by law they could. The money the city would collect would barely cover the cost of collecting. The Gray Fox has always guaranteed protection to the poor of the waterfront. He doesn't want to let this injustice stand. It's a matter of principle.
Find out where Hieronymus Lex is keeping the taxes and bring them to me. I'll also need the tax records of what each citizen paid so we can return it."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Greetings. It is high time that we met face to face, don't you think? Raminus has told me good things about you. You have advanced quickly, and show great promise. I now intend to put your talents to a more direct test.
I have a difficult task that you can, perhaps, assist with. Let me explain what is at stake. The Council of Mages has been aware of the increased Necromancer activity in Cyrodiil for some time. It had been our position to sit back and watch what unfolded, but that time has clearly passed. We cannot tolerate these attacks on the guild. Most of our information on Necromancers has come from an informant inside the cult itself, a guild member who offered to infiltrate their ranks.
Though the information he has provided is limited, it has given us a sense of their scope and power. The Council was initially reluctant to believe the information was reliable, but with recent events, they have little choice but to trust it. I fear that our informant is in danger, and that is why I have called you here.
The informant is a mage called Mucianus Allias. He is not a Council member, but has long served the guild here at the Arcane University. Aware in the growing interest in the guild after the band of Necromancy was put into place, he offered to help the Council track the cult's actions. With my blessing, he infiltrated the group, and has fed us information for quite some time, until recently. I have not heard from him, and I fear for his safety.
The lack of reports from Mucianus has disturbed the Council, and they are now concerned about the legitimacy of his information. A group of Battlemages were dispatched to Mucianus's last know location, with the intent on bringing him in for questioning. I argued against it, but eventually agreed to maintain order in the Council. I regret that decision, and that is why I wish to send you there. I fear the Battlemages may mistreat Mucianus, if they do not mistake him for one of the many Necromancers no doubt present in the ruins.
I wish for you to find Mucianus, and ensure his safe return to the Arcane University. I do not want anything to go wrong. Please, hurry. The Battlemages will arrive there soon, if they have not already, and time is of the essence. If for any reason they are unsuccessful, Mucianus' life will be forfeit. You must make sure he is safe. Go now, and bring word to me as soon as he has been escorted to safety. Mucianus last reported being sent to the ruins of Nenyond Twyll, south of the Imperial City. That is where the Battlemages went. South of the White Rose River, nearly halfway to the border of Elsweyr. I'm afraid I know nothing more about the location, or what you may expect to find once you arrive."

"Everyone is here, let's begin.
Each of you is seeking membership in the Thieves Guild. The Thieves Guild is not a myth. We are followers of the Gray Fox, and I am his Doyen.
Merely by finding me, you have passed the first test. It's unusual for us to have three potential recruits at the same time. Rather than the normal test of skill, I'm going to make this a contest. Methredhel, you know the rules. However, for Amusei and the newcomer, let me state them clearly.
Whoever brings me the diary of Amantius Allectus, without killing him, will be invited into the guild. It's somewhere in the Imperial City. The beggars will help you locate it, for a price. I can sell you lockpicks if you need them.
One more thing. You cannot kill each other during this trial. We may be thieves, but we're not murderers."

"Sheogorath is gone, but hope is not lost. We have a rare opportunity here, but I hesitate to do what must be done. If the Throne of Madness remains empty when Jyggalag storms the palace, he will prevail. But there is a chance that the throne may not be empty. The only way to protect the Realm from Jyggalag is to place you in the Throne of Madness.
Unfortunately, when Sheogorath faded, the power of the Staff of Sheogorath faded with him. It must now be remade. The Staff is the symbol of power in this Realm. He who rightfully holds the Staff may hold the throne of the Shivering Isles. However, the secrets of its construction are lost.
That which is lost can be found again. There is one being in the Shivering Isles who may be able to assist you in the construction of a new Staff. The ruins of Knifepoint Hollow once served as a great library. There, you will find a door. Behind that door, you will find the answer you seek.
Take this crystal. It contains the power to open the sealed door. Inside, you will find the final remnants of the library. Be mindful of what you find there. The library is a thing of Order, and it will still serve that end."

I need your help. I need you to send my soul away from this world! You must... you must kill me. I don't necessarily want to see it coming. And I want to die here in the city so all these people finally believe me. They'll wish they were nicer. You probably want to do it without spectators though, so you don't get in trouble.

I'm going to go about my daily life, such as it is, as if nothing has changed. Make your move when you wish. But, please, do it soon. When you kill me, take the key to my house. Nothing really worth taking, except what's locked up in the jewelry box. You can have that."

Phillida now resides in Leyawiin, in the City Watch barracks, an honored guest of the soldiers there. He is, in fact, more vulnerable than ever.
The Black Hand has sanctioned the Rose of Sithis. It is a magic arrow specifically enchanted to kill its target. In this case, Phillida. As long as the arrow hits Phillida, he will die. But it cannot pierce armor! Shoot while Phillida is armored, and the Rose will be wasted. Travel to Leyawiin. Track Phillida. Learn his schedule. Observe when he removes that blasted Legion armor! And then, let fly the Rose of Sithis! Kill Phillida in any way, Rose or not, and the contract is complete. But to receive a bonus, you must go beyond murder. You must send a message! Once Phillida is dead, take the very finger from his corpse, the one that bears an Imperial Legion signet ring! Deposit this finger in the desk of Phillida's successor, in his office in the Prison Barracks, in the Imperial City! Do this, and the bonus is yours."

Scar-Tail has fled Black Marsh and refuses to fulfill his duties as royal assassin! This is an act of treason! This treachery must be punished! Just as a member of the Dark Brotherhood cannot kill a fellow family member, a Shadowscale is forbidden from slaying another Shadowscale.

Albert Jemane kept the item in Weatherleah, but Weatherleah was ransacked by ogres: they took the item.
This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Fathis Ules. I may have a bit of a proposition for you involving the Jemane family you so recently assisted.
It was kind of you to escort the Jemanes back to Weatherleah. However, their father, the original owner of Weatherleah left them an even greater legacy.
My tale actually begins with the father, Albert Jemane. He was once in my employ, or should I say the employ of my organization. He was very good at obtaining things from people who did not want to part with. A professional thief, to put it bluntly. He was assigned to obtain a very valuable item for me. He succeeded, but decided to keep this item for himself. An unfortunate decision.
Albert Jemane fled from Chorrol with his family, and was never heard from again. Only his small son Reynald was found, wandering alone in the wilderness. Naturally, my associates and I believed he had perished. The wilderness is, after all, a dangerous place. No place to take your family. Then, these many years later, voila! The brother reappears. It seems the rest of the family did not die in the wilderness after all.
What is the point of my tale? Albert Jemane builds Weatherleah way out in the middle of nowhere. He was a thief, not a farmer. The only reason to establish such a place would be to stay out of the Chorrol Guard's sight. I believe that the item Albert stole, which rightly belongs to me, was hidden at Weatherleah. Unfortunately, the notorious Redguard Valley Ogres ransacked the place and probably took all of the loot back with them.
If you were to obtain this item, somehow, and bring it to me, I would pay you very well for it."

Vilena Donton is not going to know about this mission: it's the player's choice to accept the mission.
This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Good. You're here. We've got duties to attend to.
I've been looking into the Blackwood Company. Heard some disturbing things. We know they're a danger to us. And we know they're good at what they do.
I've heard stories, but nothing I can prove is true. Maybe they've got a mage working with them. Maybe they're just well trained. All I know for sure is that they'll accept any contract, and they'll do anything to complete it. And they don't care who gets in the way.
We were contracted by a wizard, Argoth, to recover an artifact from Azani Blackheart, a ruthless bandit leader. I went in there with twenty men. I left with five. Vitellus Donton wasn't one of them. He died covering our retreat. I snooped around. Apparently, the Blackwood Company completed that contract for us. I went in there with twenty good men. I can't believe that bunch finished the job. There's more. Argoth -- he's dead, the artifact gone. Sounds like a set-up. Maybe they made a deal with Blackheart. I don't know. But I'll find out.
Now we find out what really happened. And we let it be known. I want to show the people who the Blackwood Company really are. I can't order you do this with me. It's dangerous, and Vilena Donton isn't going to know about it. It's your choice.
If you accept this mission, we leave as soon as you're ready. I want to investigate Blackheart's stronghold at Arpenia. Meet me at the Leyawiin guild hall. We'll go from there."

This is an RPG quest from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
The quest-giver is called Sir Ralvas. Sir Ralvas is a ghost of a knight.
The quest-giver gives a quest to the player. The player's objective is to retrieve the Mace of Zenithar for yourself.
The player should first complete the challenge of Zenithar to complete their objective. This task can be completed in the following location: a shrine to Saint Kaladas, below the Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin.
The player will receive the following rewards for completing the quest objective: Mace of Zenithar (a holy mace).
The following characters are related to this quest: Zenithar (the god of work and commerce, one of the Nine), Saint Kaladas (a long-dead saint).
The following groups are related to this quest: Nine (a pantheon of gods).
The following locations are related to this quest: Leyawiin (a city).
There are some important facts concerning this quest. The player has passed the gauntlet unlike others in three hundred years: the player can redeem the souls of the ghost knights and restore their order. Sir Ralvas placed his own will and lust for fame over the will of the Nine. Sir Ralvas failed the challenge of Zenithar: the inscription for the challenge says to "walk in the faith". The player must pray at the shrine of Saint Kaladas to receive a vision: the player will see the Mace of Zenithar, separated from them by a great chasm. Sir Ralvas fell from the platform each time he tried to cross the chasm.
This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"You have my, Sir Ralvas', tribute, sir knight. In three hundred years, none have passed the gauntlet. In three hundred years, we have never known hope. But for the first time, it seems that someone may succeed where we have failed. I see in you the chance to redeem our souls and restore the order. And now, I must ask you to press forward where I could not. I must ask you to face the challenge of Zenithar.
I was arrogant and foolhardy. I sought personal glory. I placed my own will and my own lust for fame over the will of the Nine. In facing the challenge of Zenithar, I failed. I tried dozens -- no, hundreds of times to reach the Mace. I fell each time. And each time I awoke in the chapel, I leaped again. I tried to enlist the help of the other knights, but none would come to my aid. The inscription says to "walk in the faith" but even now, I do not know what this means.
Below the Chapel of Zenithar in Leyawiin there is a shrine to the great craftsman, Saint Kaladas. Those seeking the Mace must pray before the shrine. When you bow, you will receive a vision -- or perhaps not. It is unclear. The priests saw that my body never moved, but it felt so real. You will see the Mace of Zenithar, separated from you by a great chasm. The chasm represents your doubt. Your faith must be your guide across it.
This is what I know. As I said, my faith was weak. I did not understand the test and I fell from the platform each time I tried to cross. I have told you all that I know. All that is left is for you to prove yourself more worthy than I. If you seek the Mace, travel to Leyawiin's chapel, kneel at the shrine in the undercroft, and let your faith in the Nine be the salvation of us all."

The monastery is called the Temple of the Ancestor Moths. It is where retired, blind Moth priests go to wait out the rest of their days. I will mark the location on your map. Look for it in the far northeast of Cyrodiil, beyond Cheydinhal.

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Dead Drop Orders #3
by Lucien Lachance

Are you ready to get your hands dirty, Silencer?
Your next target is a Khajiit nobleman by the name of J'Ghasta, who can be found at his home in the city of Bruma. J'Ghasta was recently offered the hand of a prominent Cyrodiil noble's daughter, but turned down the offer when he learned of the girl's rather negligible dowry. The girl's family is outraged, of course, and has hired the Dark Brotherhood to make J'Ghasta pay for his insolence.
Go to J'Ghasta's house in Bruma and end his miserable life. But be warned! The Khajiit is rich and bored, and spends most of his time honing his skills in unarmed combat. Any opponent who can kill with merely his hands is not to be trifled with, so tread carefully. Even worse, J'Ghasta is aware someone may be trying to kill him, and has bribed the guards not to interfere if a fight should spill out into the city streets.
When the target has been eliminated, you will find your next dead drop in a rotten box under the Old Bridge, just south of the Imperial City. The box will contain your reward for killing J'Ghasta, as well as information regarding your next contract."

Vitellus was Vilena Donton's eldest son. Good man. We lost him on a botched mission recently. You've probably seen the other wounded around. If you're smart, you'll steer clear of the subject around the guildmaster. Perhaps you and I will have time to discuss it more later.
Viranus' mother's been holding him back, protecting him. You'll go to Nonwyll Cavern with him. Galtus Previa was lost there, and you're to find him. And not a word of this to the guildmaster! Go find him. He'll be in the Donton house, most likely. And bring him back in one piece!"

I don't suppose I could convince you to help me recover my research notes? I was doing some research in Bramblepoint Cave, and suddenly I was attacked. I grabbed everything I could and ran, but I fear I dropped my notes. Those notes are very important to me and represent ten years of my life. If you could recover them, I'd be sure to reward you appropriately with some potent potions."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"S'Krivva gives you greeting. Hieronymus Lex must be eliminated once and for all. The Gray Fox has asked that you do this personally. It is a most delicate matter.
Lady Umbranox of Anvil, is hunting for a new captain of her guard. The Legion Commander of the Imperial Watch sent her a list of candidates. The Gray Fox wants this list replaced with one that highly recommends Hieronymus Lex. From Anvil he can do little harm to the guild. The letter carrying the list is currently in steward Dairihill's desk. She has lied to Lady Umbranox, telling her that the letter has yet to arrive.
For reasons unknown to this one, the Gray Fox has extended his protection to the Umbranox family and Lady Umbranox in particular. While Lex is a problem for the guild, his unwavering loyalty and resolve make him the perfect protector for Lady Umbranox.
You will have to track down a forger on your own. I don't know of any in Bravil. With the forged letter in hand, sneak into the Legion Commander's office in the Imperial City Prison and seal it with his seal. Dairihill cannot be trusted. You must deliver the letter to Lady Umbranox in person.
Remember, this is a mission of stealth, not blood. Your payment will be higher than normal to cover the expense of the forgery."

The war changed Sir Casimir: he no longer had sympathy for the weak, or pity for the suffering. After the war, Sir Casimir tried to serve the Nine at the Chapel of Stendarr in Chorrol. Sir Casimir was cursed after killing a beggar at the Chapel of Stendarr: he was weak, constantly weary, and lacked the energy to do almost anything. The Gauntlets of the Crusader slipped from Sir Casimir's hands after killing the beggar: they are still in the Chapel of Stendarr, too heavy to move.
This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"I, Sir Casimir, know where you may find the Gauntlets of the Crusader, for I was the one who lost them when I was still alive. Though many know where they are, they are still lost. I believe there is something you must do in order to retrieve them.
When the Order fractured, I followed Sir Berich into war, taking the Gauntlets with me. When it was over, I returned to this land. I attempted to return to the service of the Nine, but the war had changed me. I no longer had sympathy for the weak, or pity for the suffering. In the brief time I was there, I did more to hurt the Chapel of Stendarr than help it. It was there that I was cursed.
A beggar who came to the Chapel each day for help tried my patience one too many times. I lost my temper, and struck him. My blow landed harder than I had intended, and he fell to the floor, dead. Killed in the very Chapel of the God of Mercy. I left the Chapel at once, of course, but the damage was done. I was weak, constantly weary, and lacked the energy to do almost anything.
As proof of the deed, when I struck the poor man the Gauntlets slipped right off my hands and fell to the floor. Heavy as stone, they would not move. None could lift them. I suspect they lie there still, in Chorrol's Chapel. You must prove to Stendarr you are worthy to lift the Gauntlets once more. Seek out the priests of Stendarr in Chorrol. Perhaps they can help you."

The unlucky kin are Perennia Draconis, Matthias Draconis, Andreas Draconis, Sibylla Draconis and Caelia Draconis. The locations of most of the family members are unknown, so you should begin your search with the family matron, Perennia, who resides at the farm called Applewatch.
You must discern the locations of all the Draconis family members and then systematically eliminate them. I suggest you first speak with the mother and find out if she has any valuable information on the whereabouts of her children, before ending her life.
When every member of the Draconis family lies dead, journey to the city of Skingrad. In the castle courtyard you will find a well containing your reward for the Draconis contract, as well any further assignment I might have."

Bjalfi snatched Rockshatter from our mantle and took off to "find his fortune" with the local Marauder gang at Fort Strand. I want that mace back. Please, I don't think he's ever coming back, and I'd hate to lose such a precious heirloom to a gang of thugs."

The quest-giver is called Lucien Lachance. Lucien Lachance is the player's superior in the Dark Brotherhood, giving quest via "Dead Drop Orders #5".
The quest-giver gives a quest to the player. The player's objective is to assassinate Alval Uvani.
The player should first locate Alval Uvani with a schedule included in this dead drop to complete their objective.
The player will receive the following rewards for completing the quest objective: the player should find Stonewall Shields: there is a dead drop behind that building in a hollowed-out tree stump containing the player's reward for the previous contract and the player's next contract.
The following characters are related to this quest: Alval Uvani (a traveling male Dunmer merchant skilled in Destruction spells, a native of Morrowind, located at Cyrodiil), Shaleez (a dead woman).
The following items are related to this quest: "Dead Drop Orders #5" (a note).
The following groups are related to this quest: Dark Brotherhood (a guild of assassins operating in Cyrodiil), Morag Tong (a guild of assassins operating in Morrowind), Dunmer (dark elves).
The following locations are related to this quest: Cyrodiil (a province), Morrowind (a province far away from Cyrodiil), Stonewall Shields (a shop in the Market District of the Imperial City), Imperial City (a large city), Leyawiin (a city).
There are some important facts concerning this quest. The note is addressed toward the player: the player is the Silence of the Dark Brotherhood. The player assassinated Shaleez for Lucien Lachance. Alval Uvani is renting a house in Leyawiin. Alval Uvani's wife hired the Dark Brotherhood to kill her husband: the Morag Tong of Morrowind can't reach Alval Uvani in Cyrodiil. Alval Uvani suffers from a rare Dunmer condition, a serious allergy to honey: he would suffer from complete paralyzation after drinking honey-based mead.
This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Dead Drop Orders #5
by Lucien Lachance

If you're reading this note, Shaleez is dead. You've done the world a great service, Silencer. It's time to continue the good work.
Your next target is a traveling Dark Elf merchant by the name of Alval Uvani, who is currently renting a house in the city of Leyawiin. Uvani is a well-respected tradesman back in his native Morrowind, but his business often takes him very far from home. Therein lies the problem. Alval Uvani's wife has become disillusioned with her husband's repeated, extended absences and wishes to dissolve their marriage, and has sought the Dark Brotherhood's assistance. Lucky for us Cyrodiil is a bit beyond the reach of Morrowind's Morag Tong.
Alval Uvani is currently traveling around Cyrodiil, and is never in one place for more than a couple of days. In this dead drop you will also find a schedule detailing the Dark Elf's whereabouts; use it to locate him and plan your elimination. Be aware, however, that because he is forced to travel alone to the farthest reaches of the Empire, Uvani has learned to defend himself. He is a master of the Destruction school of Magicka, and is no stranger to killing.
When Alval Uvani lies rotting, journey to the Market District of the Imperial City. There you will find a shop called Stonewall Shields. Your dead drop is located behind that building, in a hollowed-out tree stump. As usual, you will find your reward for the previous contract, as well as information on your next.
Ah yes, I must mention one last detail. Apparently Alval Uvani suffers from a rare Dark Elf condition, a serious allergy to honey. If you could somehow get Uvani to drink the honey-based mead, perhaps by replacing his food, he would suffer from complete paralyzation. This would certainly make the Dark Elf a bit easier to deal with."

"I've deciphered part of the ritual needed to open a portal to Camoran's Paradise.
The Mysterium Xarxes mentions four items needed for the ritual, but so far I have only deciphered one of them: the 'blood of a Daedra Lord'.

Not an easy thing to come by, obviously, but we will need a Daedric artifact.
The only way to obtain a Daedric artifact is through the cults devoted to each of the Daedric Lords. The book "Modern Heretics" is the best introduction to Daedric cults. The library here has a copy if you need it.
Bring the artifact to me when you have acquired one. Remember, the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will consume the physical form of the artifact in order to release its Daedric power."

In order to receive your bonus, you must kill each guest secretly, one by one. If anyone sees you committing murder, the bonus is forfeit. The guests believe there is a chest of gold hidden in the house, and have agreed to be locked inside until one of them finds it. In fact, the guests believe the key to the manor is inside the chest, and only by satisfying their greed will they be allowed to leave. Poor fools. There is, of course, no chest of gold. The guests will find no key. After you arrive, the doors will be locked behind you, as everyone expects. When all the guests lie dead, you will be free to leave.
Now go, see the doorman at Summitmist Manor. He will explain the rest. Have fun."

I'm a fisherman. Or at least, I was. Until one of those slaughterfish damn near took my leg off. I was collecting their scales, see. I had a contract with this young alchemist. You wouldn't believe what he was paying for those scales! Then last month, one of the bastards got ahold of my leg. Took me right out of the business. But this alchemist, he needs the scales right away. The alchemist was paying so much for the scales that I'm close to having enough saved so that I can retire. But now, I can't get out there to Lake Rumare -- not with this leg. I only needed twelve more scales! Can you believe it? I was so close!
I've picked up a few things in my travels. If you head out there and bring me back the twelve scales that I need, I can make it worth your time. Help an old fisherman out, won't you?"

Perhaps the others came after you. Your need must be great for the gods to allow us to speak. Has Umaril the Accursed found a way back? The foulest of a foul race. A thousand curses upon his unholy name!
I thought I'd won. But I should have known. The Slavemasters are a cunning breed. Umaril found a way to cheat death, as I could not. If you would seek for my Relics, I know little that can help you. All that has passed since my death is like mist that my mind cannot take hold of. My friends built a shrine upon the site of my death, Vanua, where the Ayleid Elves tormented me in a final act of revenge. I can show you where it once stood. Perhaps it is there still.
Fare thee well, sir knight. May the gods grant you to destroy Umaril utterly, as I failed to do."

The Knights of the Thorn are a bunch of rabble who fancy themselves true knights. Farwil formed the group around two years ago. They make grand boasts, and talk a good talk, but that's all they are.

I know this is an unexpected turn of events, but drastic measures must be taken. Ocheeva, Vicente Valtieri, Antoinetta Marie, Gogron gro-Bolmog, Telaendril, M'raaj-Dar and Teinaava. All of these family members must die! From this point forward, you are no longer bound by the Five Tenets! Sithis will forgive any murder, any theft, so long as you serve the Black Hand!
When the rite of Purification has been completed, return to me here at Fort Farragut, and we will discuss your future. Now, take these special gifts. They will help you greatly. One is a poisoned apple. The other, a unique scroll of summoning. Good luck... assassin."

"Dead Drop Orders #7
by Lucien Lachance

My compliments on another job well done! Havilstein Hoar-Blood was more swine than man, and deserved to die quivering like an animal! You must not stop! You must kill again!
Your next target is a Wood Elf named Ungolim, who resides in the city of Bravil. Bravil is also home to an ancient statue known as the Lucky Old Lady. It is seen as a symbol of good luck and prosperity, and the fools of Bravil often speak to the statue and wish for good tidings. Every night, poor lovestruck Ungolim visits the statue and pleads desperately for the heart of a young maiden. This maiden is married, and her husband has learned of Ungolim's affection for his bride. He fears the competition, it would seem, and has commissioned the Dark Brotherhood to help in the matter.
You must go to Bravil, locate Ungolim, and kill him. The Wood Elf owns a house in the city, but he spends his days securely locked inside. I recommend you lie in wait at the Lucky Old Lady statue, and then eliminate Ungolim when he arrives for his nightly visit. He's generally there between the hours of 6:00 PM and 1:00 AM.
By all accounts, Ungolim is a deadly archer and a fearless opponent. I also have reason to believe he is expecting trouble, so if Ungolim senses danger, he may attack you on sight. Be vigilant, and bring the Wood Elf down! You must not fail!
When Ungolim's body lies broken at the foot of his dear statue, you must journey to the city of Anvil. Your dead drop is in a barrel located behind the statue in the pond. As is standard, your reward and next contract will be waiting."

You must go to the city of Chorrol and break into the house of Francois Motierre. Inside you will find Motierre waiting for you. Do not kill him! You see, Francois Motierre is a marked man. He owes a considerable sum to the wrong kind of people. So, they have sent an enforcer to kill him. This is an unusual contract, Motierre had to make a special arrangement with us before it was approved. I trust in your professionalism.
Here, take this knife. The blade has been coated with a rare poison called Languorwine. One drop in a normal human bloodstream will mimic the effects of death immediately. I will provide you with a vial of antidote, which will be used to revive Francois Motierre after you successfully stage his death. You should also know that there's only enough Languorwine on the blade for this one contract. After Motierre is sliced, the knife will be useless.
As payment, I'll be pleased to award you this amulet, Cruelty's Heart."

My friend, you must travel to Crowhaven and use the key to unlock whatever it is that holds the proof of my birthright! Find this proof and return it to me, and I'll share with you some of my finest combat techniques. Trust me, you can't learn these moves in a book!"

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Crumpled Note
by G.S.

I guess you found the message I told you about, old friend. We've traveled together for so long, and you're the only one I trust with the ring and my story.
I knew climbing into the window of that wizard's house was a mistake, but the bounty on the ring was just too enticing to pass up. They said it was worth thousands of drakes... enough to keep me comfortable for a while as I lay low. They also said the owner of the ring was out of town at some meeting of wizards or some such.
They were wrong on both counts. You'd think I'd be used to this by now, dealing with the unpredictable in our line of work. But after trying to fence the ring all over the realm, no one would touch it. Worse still, the wizard was pursuing me the entire time. I had to call in many favors to stay one step ahead of him.
I decided to strike north and make for the neighboring land. As I was crossing the Jeralls, he finally caught up to me. Two fireballs later, I found myself tumbling down a steep snowy slope into a valley. Don't know where I am, but there are ruins of some old fort here. Luckily, that fetcher didn't follow me down; I assume he gave me up for dead.
I think I'm going to stash the ring in this valley, cross the border north, and return later when I feel it's safe. I've used some old chests I found in the ruins to make sure nobody stumbles across the ring by mistake; you know, the old key to a key thing like we used to do. If I don't make it back here, and you're reading this message, then the ring is all yours, my friend. Use it well and remember me.
G.S."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"These stupid scamps are driving me crazy! I'm at my wit's end! I, Rosentia Gallenus, beg you to help me!
The beastly little creatures are nasty, smelly, noisy and wrecking my beautiful house! I must be rid of them! I can't let people know I have scamps in here, or they'll think I've taken to Daedra worship. Try explaining that to the town guard.
I had a feeling buying that Daedric Staff would be trouble. Now I'm paying for it with more than just some gold. A few weeks ago, a spellsword was passing through Leyawiin and heard that I like to buy curiosities. He wanted to sell the staff you see me carrying. I eagerly bought it, knowing the value of Daedric relics. In fact, I was a bit suspicious when he sold it so cheap. His loss, my gain I figured. After examining it for a bit I noticed a small word carved on it in runes. Using a book from my library, I translated it. The word was nonsense. However, when I spoke it and held the staff, four scamps suddenly appeared! I thought I was done for! Strangely, they all just stood there. It didn't take long before I realized they were following me! I couldn't be seen in town with scamps following, so I decided to discard the staff. I can't explain it, but somehow I can't compel myself to actually let it go. This staff is obviously cursed! Now I'm stuck with it.
Oh please, I beg you! Take this staff to Darkfathom Cave and get rid of it and the scamps forever! I can't fight, and who knows what's guarding the shrine? Plus, do you know how dirty caves are? It'll ruin anything I wear!
Do this for me, and I'll reward you with another one of my curios I picked up a few years ago... a valuable ring. Ring of Eidolon's Edge."

It's powerful and tremendously addicting... I've seen men fail to finish even a single flask.
If I knew where they were stashing the bottles, I'd put an end to it myself. Could you track down the stash? That would be helpful. I just don't have time to do it myself right now.

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Heddic's Volunruud Notes
by Heddic Volunnar

I was skeptical, but it's obvious now. The old hymns had truth to them! The relief wasn't far from the entrance, just as they said. I've no doubt now that it hides the entrance to Kvenel's tomb.
The two keys must be hidden somewhere nearby - ceremonial replicas of Okin and Eduj, favored weapons when Kvenel went into battle. I don't dare explore further without hiring bodyguards to accompany me, however. To think - The Tongue Chieftain Kvenel could be entombed behind just a few feet of stone! The ancestor we scarcely believed was real.
Twice damned for planning this foolish scouting trip. I should have hired those sellswords in the first place. Perhaps there's no need. This place is just a tomb, after all, and there are no obvious signs of habitation. It isn't as though the thousand-year dead will mind if I have a look around."

"Come to gawk at the monster?
A little girl is dead because of me. Believe me, it wasn't anything I ever intended to do. I just... lost control. I tried to tell them, but none of them believe me.
It's all on account of this blasted ring. This is the Ring of Hircine. I was told it could let me control my transformations. Perhaps it used to. But I'll never know. Hircine didn't care for my taking it, and threw a curse on it. I put it on... and the changes just came to me. I could never guess when. It would be at the worst times. Like... with the little girl.
I don't suppose there's a point in keeping the secret if I'm going to die in here anyway. I'm sure you've heard of men who shift to beasts under the influence of the moons. I am one of them. A werewolf. It's my secret, and my shame. That's why I wanted the ring... it was said to give men like me control. Now I may look like a man, but I still feel the animal inside of me, as strong as ever.
You would take the ring back to Hircine? Oh my. You would do this for me? Here, take it. I don't want anything to do with this wretched thing anymore. Seek out the beast. He wanders these woods. Bring him down and... well, the Lord of the Hunt should smile on you and appear before you.
I wish you luck, but should leave here while I still have my skin. Should our paths cross again, I will remember your kindness. Farewell."

Our own security forces are limited, and all the mercenaries are tied up in this ridiculous war. We don't even know their base of operations, and attacking single ships won't really solve the problem.
Only the Shatter-Shields appear safe. They are a very powerful family here in Windhelm. They run a private shipping operation, and would love to have the docks to themselves. Wouldn't surprise me if they were in league with the pirates, somehow.
Not yet, no. But perhaps an intrepid person such as yourself could help with that. They have a dark elf who oversees their operations. Suvaris Atheron. She's meticulous to a fault, and keeps a logbook with every transaction she makes.
If you get me the logbook, I'll have proof of Shatter-Shield's treachery."

"You're here! And not a moment too soon. If anything should happen to Arn, there'll be hell to pay.
Arn's a close friend of mine. We fought together on the battlefield for many years until old age got the better of us. Now it's up to me to save him one more time... this time from the executioner's block in Solitude.
The city guard in Solitude is seeking Arn for a serious crime. When he fled here, he was arrested for drunken behavior. Can you imagine? Fortunately, his identity isn't known to the authorities in Whiterun, so there's still a chance to save him.
The job is two-fold. First, steal a letter that was sent from Solitude warning Whiterun's guard to be on the lookout for Arn. The second is to change Arn's name in the prison registry to his new identity.
The job is relatively difficult. If it was easy, I would have hired a local thug instead of a professional from the Thieves Guild. You see both of these items are kept inside Dragonsreach, and they don't allow visitors inside the Jarl's or the Steward's chambers.
One more thing. If you get caught, I can't afford to be connected to you. Remember that before you do anything stupid."

This is the quest description, the quest-giver explaining the quest to the player:
"Have you heard the story of how we came to be werewolves?
The Companions are nearly five thousand years old. This matter of beastblood has only troubled us for a few hundred. One of my predecessors was a good, but short-sighted man. He made a bargain with the witches of Glenmoril Coven. If the Companions would hunt in the name of their lord, Hircine, we would be granted great power.
The Companions of old became werewolves. They did not believe the change would be permanent. The witches offered payment, like anyone else. But we had been deceived. The disease, you see, affects not just our bodies. It seeps into the spirit. Upon death, werewolves are claimed by Hircine for his Hunting Grounds. For some, this is a paradise. They want nothing more than to chase prey with their master for eternity. And that is their choice. But I am still a true Nord. And I wish for Sovngarde as my spirit home.
I've spent my twilight years trying to find a cure myself. And now I've found the answer. The witches' magic ensnared us, and only their magic can release us. They won't give it willingly, but we can extract their foul powers by force. I want you to seek them out. Go to their coven in the wilderness. Strike them down as a true warrior of the wild. And bring me their heads. The seat of their abilities. From there, we may begin to undo centuries of impurity."

As a scholar of history, I've always found Solstheim to be most intriguing. I've made many forays into the ancient ruins that cover the island. I've come to know those ruins so well, I could draw you a map from memory. That's why I noticed the new passage the moment I laid eyes on it.
it leads to an old tomb, I think. It must have been opened by an earthquake that accompanied one of the Red Mountain's eruptions. I'd love to have a closer look, but those old ruins can be dangerous and I'm no adventurer. I'll pay you to watch my back down there.
I'll be heading back there soon. If you're interested, meet me at the ruins and we'll see what we can find. Now I'm off to pack for the expedition!"

No need to explain, I'm well aware of your Guild's methods do not include killing. It took me weeks, but I finally tracked down the killer. A bloody Altmer at that. Can you imagine? Let's just say I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye and leave it at that.
The killer fancied himself a thief in some sort of a new Guild forming around here. Gave me some valuable information before... well, you know. Well, I think we can help each other. You recover what I'm looking for and take out a rival Guild in the process. One of the pieces stolen from Fjotli was a silver locket, a Cruel-Sea family heirloom. I want it back.
The only name I have is Niranye. Has a house right here in Windhelm. That's where you should begin looking."

The longer it remains here, the more dangerous the situation becomes. And so I have come here personally to tell you it must be dealt with.
I fear I have already overstepped the bounds of my Order, but I will offer this: seek out the Augur of Dunlain here in your College. His perception may be more coherent than ours."

Idiots! Brodir and Herd were at each others' throats again today, and nearly came to blows. The whole camp is on edge. I've ordered an extra ration of mead, but unless this fighting stops, we'll tear ourselves apart.

11th of First Seed, 4E 201
Rumor is that Herd's gathering followers for a mutiny. Brodir's not stupid; he's probably doing the same, just for insurance. I'd kill them both myself, but the camp's split right down the middle. If I tried, there'd be a knife in my back within a week.
I can't take this anymore. I've begun skimming a little gold from the take, bringing it down here when I can. If I can scrape enough together, I'll make a run for it, head downriver to Dragon Bridge.

28th of First Seed, 4E 201
Brodir's getting suspicious -- I caught him poking around in the cove this afternoon. I don't think he found my stash, but it's not safe here. I took the boat out tonight and stowed it on the island to the south, by the old tree stump.
Had a good haul this week. Another caravan or two and I can finally get out of here, and not a moment too soon."

According to my grandfather at least, the family shield should be in the cave. He swore that version of the legend was true, even found the cave old Lenne stumbled into: Ansilvund. Hey, if you find it, I could show you some of the clan's favorite fighting moves. They're all shield techniques."

I've got to stay here, to see if we can get to Ancano and stop this. I need someone I can trust to do it. If the stories about the staff are true, if it really can absorb a tremendous amount of power, maybe we can break through Ancano's magic.
You know that the staff is in Labyrinthian? Are you... Are you sure? The staff is there? That can't be a coincidence. The Arch-Mage. Before... before he died. He... He gave me something just a little while ago. He told me it was from Labyrinthian, and that I would know what to do with it when the time came. I think... I think he meant this for you, then. I'm not sure why, but there was something very personal about it for him. Also, I think you should take this amulet. It belonged to Savos, but I think would do you the most good now. Take it, and get out of here.
Bring back that staff before Ancano brings the whole College down around us. If we can't stop this, what happens to the rest of Skyrim?"

If you can bring me these materials, the Phial can again be made whole. You can keep the White Phial after I have repaired it. I fear keeping the Phial would just remind me of Nurelion's obsession, and how it consumed him."

It's a copy of the Gourmet's cookbook. Ah, but not just any copy. It's signed you see! Seems to be a message from the Gourmet to one Anton Virane. I've tracked Virane to the keep in Markarth. It would seem he's the cook.
You are to obtain that information from Virane - who the Gourmet really is, and where he can be found. Oh, and when you're done with Virane, kill him. Loose ends and all that.
As I was saying... You'll need to kill the Gourmet, of course. But what's more, you'll need to get his Writ of Passage, so you can take his place. Oh, and if you can, hide his body. The longer it takes for anyone else to determine his real identity, the better.

"Eisa's Journal
by Eisa Blackthorn

Night shift woke me to say they'd hit something big. Kyr, Ra'jirr, and I went down to take a look. It's huge, like a whole forest was just swallowed up by the earth, with a big old monument out in the center. Kyr took a sword from the monument as a trophy and dubbed it the "Pale Blade", proof his whole plan was finally paying off. For once, he might be right.

Ra'jirr's been having nightmares over the past few days. He keeps muttering about a "Pale Lady" - one of those swamp women who steal children away at night, I think. To think some fool story could turn the toughest bandit I know into a cowering kitten, frightened of his own shadow. I'm just glad none of the others see him like this.

It's getting worse. Ra'jirr can barely sleep at all now, and whenever he dozes off, he wakes up screaming - woke the whole place last night. He says the "Pale Lady" is coming for us - she's down in the forest, we have to return the sword or she'll kill us all. Not a chance - the boss clings to that thing like he was born with it. I've told everyone Ra'jirr just has a fever, but this can't go on. I've pulled a few things together. I'll slip out tonight and never look back."

In keeping with tradition, you must use a specific tool in the Ancestor Glade, an implement known as a Draw Knife. Every Moth Priest is taught this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it... you should consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.
Once enough of the moths are following, they'll provide you with the second sight needed to decipher the Elder Scrolls. From what I saw in the vision, the Elder Scroll which foreshadows the defiance of the gods with the blood of mortals is the key to the prophecy."

Recently, a woman was found... naked and shivering along the road to Dawnstar. The only information the guard could get from her were tales of strange experiments and Arondil scribbling in his journals.
He used to have a home in Dawnstar until they burned it down. The people say he was doing unspeakable experiments on reanimation... rituals only a necromancer would perform. After he made for Yngvild, he was never heard from again.
In his later years, Arondil moved into some ice caves known as Yngvild. He preferred the solitude in which to perform his, um... experiments."

He mostly keeps to himself, and so far he's been able to pay. I just hate to see what's happened to him. He hasn't always been like this, you know. Drunk, I mean.
He was a different person. Happy, outgoing... Like anyone who's in love. See, Ranmir was involved with a pretty young woman named Isabelle Rolaine. The two of them were very happy together, I thought. One day, she just disappeared. Ranmir was convinced she'd run off with someone else, leaving him behind. He turned to drinking, and what's left of him is what you see here every day.
I hoped that maybe if she could be found, if he had some sort of explanation, that maybe he could put himself back together. I'm in no position to go searching for her, but perhaps you could. Ranmir seemed convinced that Isabelle'd run off to Riften with someone named Vex. That's all I remember."

I do not have one in my possession. Nor do you, I'm sure. So we require a Dremora to retrieve one for us. You will summon one, and order it to bring a sigil stone to you. I will then inscribe the spells for you.
But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora. Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding. You must first prove you are in control.
I will teach you the spell to summon the Dremora, but know that it will only work in a place properly prepared for the event. Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there."

"Daynas Valen's Notes
by Daynas Valen

How to summarize a lifetime of research? So little of what I have learned matters now - the petty politics of ancient times, the age-long campaign to wipe out all mention of the Gauldur name.
In the opening days of the First Era, the Archmage Gauldur was revered throughout the north. Wisdom, wealth, honor, and power were his, and even the legendary heros' heirs sought his counsel.
Smothered by his shadow, Gauldur's three sons grew cruel and resentful. They lusted after their father's power and prestige, and eventually Jyrik, the eldest, discovered its source: a mysterious amulet, from which he never parted. Together, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his amulet between them. And so it was done.
Consumed by their newfound power, the brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages. So great was the carnage that the High King himself intervened, sending a company of battlemages led by the Archmage Geirmund to subdue the brothers. And after a devastating battle, the three fled the field.
Mikrul, the youngest, was run to ground in Folgunthur, the ancient barrows at the foot of Solitude. Geirmund pursued Jyrik to the shattered crypts of Saarthal, half-buried even then. And at last, Sigdis was cornered in the southernmost reaches of land and later entombed in Geirmund's Hall."

Cicero's taken to locking himself in the Night Mother's chamber, and talking. To someone. In hushed, but frantic tones. Who is he speaking with? What are they planning? I fear treachery. As the Night Mother's Keeper, he believes he's entitled to the rule of this Sanctuary. Cicero will cite our independence as the need to revert to the Old Ways. He'll claim we're undisciplined, unruly. Heretical, even. Ironically, the Night Mother could prove to be just as much a victim. The queen in a fool's twisted game of chess.
I need you to steal into that chamber, and eavesdrop on their meeting. It'll be no use clinging to the shadows. They'll see you for sure. No, you need a hiding place. Somewhere they'd never think to look. Like inside the Night Mother's coffin."

Mani and Sudi continue to bicker and harass each other and they seem to have started in on their mother as well. Ramati keeps finding things missing from the cellar. Sudi said she heard a noise down there but Mani just thinks their mother is going mad from isolation. The very thought of it is ridiculous, she's always wanted to retire here!
Sudi keeps saying that she hears scratching coming from the cellar at night. I think she's just trying to get her mother's goat, but I'd better head into town to get a few traps just in case it's rats. Should only take a couple days. I just hope those two go easy on Ramati while I'm gone.
Oh gods. Oh gods why? I returned home to find my beautiful Ramati killed and this thing, this horrible bug-like creature ransacking our home. I managed to kill the damned thing, I think it might be a demon! I've never seen anything like it! Oh gods poor Ramati. It must have come out of the cellar. I'm going down there and locking the door behind me to make sure they don't escape. I don't know if I'll make it out, but I have to save my family!"

We were supposed to find a sacrifice. Human sacrifice. I told her I couldn't do it and she attacked me. I've done horrible things living here, but never taken an innocent life. I couldn't just find some person for them to kill. We needed a sacrifice for the Initiation. My mother is going to become one of those things, Hagravens. I can't be a part of that. Gods, I can't run away from this.
I'm going up there to stop her. This cycle must end. I don't know what brought you here, but I could use your help, if you're willing. Follow me. We have to fight our way up the Tower. I don't think anyone else here is about to have a change of heart."

"Who in the blazes are you?! Can't you see I'm busy? Or, perhaps you could help me. Hmph, maybe. Been difficult trusting people lately, they think I'm crazy.
Mark my words, these mines hold a secret that could put Raven Rock back on the map. A secret the East Empire Company swept under the rug two centuries ago. It killed my great-grandfather, Gratian Caerellius, and left Raven Rock with a worthless and tainted mine.
East Empire Company called it "a terrible accident", claiming that he was lost in a rockfall, but I know better. My wife and I were cleaning out our home, and we came across some of my great-grandfather's things locked in an old chest. I found an unsent letter he'd written to the East Empire Company, and a key.
The letter describes a discovery that was made in the mine by some of the diggers. They wanted Gratian to take a closer look. The East Empire Company must have felt it was of great value, as they locked that section of the mine off from everyone else. I assume the key unlocks that section of the mine. I haven't been able to find the entrance.
I'm telling you... there's something big down there, something that the East Empire Company wanted to hide from everyone."

I did see something in the woods on the day he disappeared. I saw two elves in the far distance, dragging something behind them. Hunters often visit our lands, so I thought little of it.

"Midden Incident Report
by Anonymous

The missing students were found in the Midden this morning. Dead, as expected. None of us bothered keeping a detect life charm for the search at this point.
The bodies were found together, each suffering the same deformities; peeled and bubbling skin on the arms and face. Conjurer's burn, as it's commonly referred to around the College. There's little doubt they were attempting a summoning ritual well beyond their capabilities.
The relic nearby put any doubt in this theory to rest. I admit that I've never seen one like it - a large, segmented sculpture of a gauntlet, the Daedric sigil 'O' emblazoned upon the palm. Attempts to move it were in vain. I must show it to the Archmage during his upcoming visit. Perhaps he will know more.
While we couldn't move the relic, I was able to pry four "rings" from it. I'm sure there's a connection between them and the ritual the students were attempting.
I'll store these in the Arcanaeum until we can consult with a conjuration master to learn more."

In the Legion, the Imperial smiths used to read books when they couldn't set their hammers straight. Wisdom of the old, I guess. If you find a book called 'The Last Scabbard of Akrash', could you bring it to me? Tacitus sure isn't learning by example.
Books. Don't know why the Imperials like them so much. It should help the boy, though, Malacath willing. Bring the book, and I'll show you how an Orc learns to smith."
